If you are coming from Ruby
 or another dynamic language you are used
 to mocking and stubbing extensively for testing.
 This works fabulously well in Ruby,
  for example, where you can easily modify a class or object at
  runtime when testing it. Because Go is strongly typed
  and statically compiled, mocking and stubbing is harder
  to achieve and far less flexible. You can do it to an
  extent, but you’re really working against the grain of the language.
 But that doesn’t mean that you can’t test your code just as well.

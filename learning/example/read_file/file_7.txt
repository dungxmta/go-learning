1.1 Introduction
Welcome and thank you for purchasing Sublime Text Power User!
As a developer, your editor is one of the most powerful tools that you have to
increase productivity and develop higher quality code. Learning to master your
editor is no different than learning to master your programming of choice. By
reading this book and learning to take advantage of every feature in Sublime Text,
you are committing to becoming a better and more well-rounded developer.
Over the past 3.5 years, I've been a full-time Sublime Text user with a constant
hunger for getting to know the editor better. This is the book I wish I would have
had.
Whether you are new to programming or a seasoned vet, get ready for a torrent of
everything from neat little tricks, to foundational workflow ideas.
1.1 Mac, Windows, Linux
Most of the features and functionalities of Sublime Text are available on Mac,
Windows and Linux. I have written this book from the perspective of a Mac user,
but provide insight for Windows and Linux users when the operating systems are
inconsistent.

Sublime Text Power UserJump Around!
This book is written in small easy to digest sections and can be read from start to
finish, but doesn't necessarily need to be. With the exception of the first few
chapters, feel free to jump around to the parts that you need to reference.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 2
Getting Started
2.1 Version 2 or 3?
The current stable release of Sublime Text is version 2.0.2. That said, version 3 was
released in early 2013, to much acclaim, and is the preferred build at this time.
Although many add-ons and packages were initially incompatible with version 3
many projects have moved to support it.
If you are currently using version 2, it is highly recommended that you migrate to
Sublime Text 3. A migration guide can be found at http://wesbos.com/migrating-to-
sublime-text-3.
13 of 225
Sublime Text Power User2.2 Installing Sublime Text
This is the obvious first step for getting started with Sublime Text. There are three
versions of Sublime Text available at http://www.sublimetext.com/3dev - Stable,
Dev and Nightly. It's recommended that you run the Dev version which delivers
semi-frequent updates. These releases are also fairly stable and give you access to
some of the new and exciting features that may not make it into the Stable version
for a number of months. If you want to live on the edge, using the Nightly version
may be more your style. Since Sublime Text is so dang fast, it takes just seconds to
upgrade to the latest build.
2.3 Installing Package Control
Like most editors, Sublime Text supports addons/plugins/extensions called
packages that extend the native functionality of the editor. We will dive into the
powerful package ecosystem more thoroughly in later Chapters of this book. For
now, to get our environment setup, we need to install something called Package
Control.
Created by the very talented Will Bond, this package manager allows you to easily
add, edit and delete your Sublime Text packages right from the editor - no fiddling
with downloads, updates or versions. There is a one time install to get the Package
Manager running.
1. Head on over to https://packagecontrol.io/installation and copy the install code on the page
Note: Make sure to check the version of Sublime Text you're running. You can find this out by
clicking on "Help > Documentation" and the appropriate version 2 or 3 support guide will be
shown.
1. Open the console by hitting the key combination Ctrl ~
14 of 225
Sublime Text Power User2. Paste the previously copied text into the prompt followed by enter
3. Restart your editor
This process will install the Sublime Package Manager and allows us to install
third-party packages.
Installing a package
Installing a package with Package Control couldn't be easier. All packages are
hosted either on Bitbucket or GitHub. Fortunately for us, package control will
interface with these websites so we don't ever have to leave the editor.
Once you have package control installed, via the instructions above, open up the
command palette with ⌘ + Shift + p or by clicking Tools → Command
Palette and type install . You should be able to select the item that says
Package Control: Install Package . If you don't see it, you need to go
back to the previous steps and make sure you have installed package control
properly.
If this is your first time installing a package or if you haven't installed one in a
while, you may have to wait a few seconds while package control fetches the latest
list of plugins. You can see that it's working in the lower left hand status bar:
15 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce it has finished fetching the list, you will be presented with a list of every
package available. Simply search for the one you are looking for by typing its name
or scrolling down. You'll be required to do this often in this book; so getting
comfortable with this process is a good idea.
Installing Packages Manually
Sometimes you may find a package that isn't in package control and you will need
to install it manually; follow these steps in those cases:
1. Install Git on your computer
2. Grab the desired package's URL from its repo page
3. Open up your computer's terminal or command line and navigate to the packages directory. You can
do this by typing cd followed by one of the following paths:
◦ Mac: ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages
◦ Windows: %APPDATA%\Sublime Text 2\Packages
◦ Linux: ~/.config/sublime-text-3
4. Clone the package using: git clone [your-git-url] .
16 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserYour package should now be installed and ready to use!
Note: Package URLs should be located at the bottom right hand side of a GitHub repo or the top
right of a Bitbucket repo
Note: If you are using Sublime Text 3, change the "2" in the packages directory paths above to "3"
Cloning Example: For the Vintageous package, my command would be: git clone
https://github.com/guillermooo/Vintageous.git
Adding a Repository
As of Sublime Text 3, we now have an easier way to do manual package
installations. Using the command palette type in "Package Repo". Once there,
look for Package Control: Add repository and select it. It will then prompt you
for the GitHub or Bitbucket URL. Paste in your git URL and Sublime will attempt
to install the package for you.
2.4 Onward
That is all there is to set up Sublime Text for now. In the coming Chapters, we will
review every personalization possible to make the editor a perfect fit for you.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 3
Getting Comfortable With The
Command Palette
In the last Chapter, we briefly touched on the command palette as a way to install
a package. Let's take a look at how we can do almost anything with this handy tool.
Although most commands can be accessed through Sublime Text's menu system,
it's always faster, and more savvy, to use keyboard shortcuts or the commands
menu.
Let's look at some examples that you'd encounter fairly often when developing.
A command palette is often a new concept for users. I myself took time before finally
familiarizing and utilizing it to its full extent. Don't make that same mistake. The command palette
is one of the most powerful tools in Sublime Text, Helping speed up your workflow significantly.
18 of 225
Sublime Text Power User3.1 Goto Anything
Goto Anything is a very powerful ability to have at your disposal. It works by
bringing up a palette that allows you to navigate to any file, line or symbol within
your current projects or open files. As you type, Sublime gives you a live preview
to help narrow down your search.
To bring up the Goto Anything palette, press ⌘ + P . There are also a few more
specific shortcuts in the paragraphs below. You can always close this box by
pressing ESC or the open keystrokes again.
Windows and Linux users should use Ctrl in place of ⌘
Files
When you press ⌘ + P you will be presented with a list of files, folders or
projects you currently have open. The most recently used files will be at the top of
this list. From here you can start to narrow down your search by typing the name of
the file, folder or project you're looking for. Using the arrow keys, you can move up
and down these items.
You'll notice that Sublime Text also provides a quick preview of files found using
this search. Clicking or hitting enter on a file in the list of results will open it for
you.
19 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserUsing this shortcut is much quicker then clicking around your sidebar and rooting
for the file you want. If you know you are looking for file named style.scss ,
you don't need to spend time drilling down folders, when you can simply pop open
Goto and start typing.
If you have multiple matches for the same file name, no worries; Sublime helps you
out by showing each file's path directly below its name.
20 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserLine Numbers
Goto Anything also allows you to jump to a specific line number within a file.
When you bring up the palette, start your query with : followed by the line
number you wish to go to.
Example: If I'm working on a file that gives me an error on line 235, I just need to type :235
into the Goto Anything palette. Better yet, hitting Ctrl + G will both bring up the Goto
Anything palette and pre-populate it with : .
21 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFuzzy Search
If you've never heard of a fuzzy search before, you can think of it is a way of
searching through documents for an approximate string of text rather than an exact
match. I'll leave the complex, algorithmic interpretation out for now; just know that
you don't need to type an entire word or phrase to find a match.
To do a fuzzy search, it's the same idea as with line numbers. The only difference is
that you use the pound symbol # instead of the colon : .
Example: Let's say I had a copy of the jQuery source open and I wanted to find all instances of
"jQuery" I'd simply open the Goto Anything palette and type #jq . I'll now be able to quickly see
and page through the matches from my fuzzy search.
Developers often use this technique to do a quick search of their files to get to a
certain line or section of code. It is an easier way to quickly scan a document for
symbols or key combinations.
22 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserNote: Fuzzy search also works in the command palette for command names. A good example of
this would be to quickly change the syntax highlighting of an open document. To do this, hit
Ctrl + Shift + P and then type ssjs . You can see that the fuzzy search finds and
highlights all the commands with the letters ssjs in them. You can read more about this in the
command palette section.
23 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserCode & Text Blocks
You're probably familiar with the pain associated in searching for a specific
function, class, or chunk of text in a file. Sublime lets you quickly navigate through
these blocks of text and code by opening the Goto Anything palette ( ⌘ + P ) and
typing @ (or just ⌘ + R ). You're able to use the previously noted fuzzy search to
filter this list for specific functions, classes or blocks of text.
Example viewing a PHP file:
Example viewing a Python file:
Example viewing a CSS file:
24 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserExample viewing a Markdown file:
As you can see, this works great in pretty much every language. For instance, in a
JavaScript file you will see a list of all available functions whereas in a CSS file all
selector classes and IDs are shown.
The implementation for Markdown is also extremely helpful as it allows you to
jump between sections of content, as seen below:
25 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserEven better, Sublime Text 3 has introduced the ability to use this feature across
your entire project and open documents. This means if you created a function or
class in one file, you can quickly find or reference it while viewing another.
Note: You can use ⌘ + R to open Goto Anything and pre-populate the search with @
Chaining Commands
All of the features discussed so far are great as standalone features but become even
more powerful when used together.
For example, if you had a file in your project named plugin.py and wanted to
find that file, open it and then find a specific function within that file named
runCommand() you could by simply typing something similar to plug@rc .
26 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserExcluding Files & Folders From Search
There may be files or folders that you do not want to see in your Goto Anything
searches. Things like compiled JavaScript from CoffeeScript, compiled CSS from
Sass or any other assets. If you'd like to exclude specific files you can by modifying
your user settings file (Preferences → Settings - User) and defining the
binary_file_patterns property.
"binary_file_patterns": [".DS_Store", ".gitignore", "*.psd"]
The example above ignores any .DS_Store , .gitignore or .psd files. To
exclude entire folders, you can append a forward slash / to the end of a folder
name.
"binary_file_patterns": ["node_modules/", "vendor/", "tmp/"]
Note: You may be tempted to use the file_exclude_patterns or
folder_exclude_patterns properties to exclude files from Goto Anything instead of
binary_file_patterns . While these both do the job, they also happen to remove those
files and folders from the sidebar - which may not be a desirable outcome.
27 of 225
Sublime Text Power User3.2 Changing Syntax
Often you find yourself opening new tabs to quickly jot down temporary copy or
code. Unfortunately, your tab has no knowledge of what language you're typing in
and none of your packages will kick in. Unless you save the file, which is not your
intention, you will have to set the document's language manually to see proper
syntax highlighting.
Fortunately, you can see what syntax the tab is currently interpreting your code as
in the bottom righthand corner. Clicking on that name will allow you to choose
between the list of supported syntaxes.
Eliminating unnecessary use of your mouse is always top of mind; So, opening the
command palette and using the fuzzy search feature, noted earlier in this Chapter, is
the ideal way to find and set your desired syntax.
28 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserNote: Using a fuzzy search that contains ss or syntax helps quickly narrow down syntax
highlighting commands as they all begin with Set Syntax.
29 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserKeyboard Shortcuts
If you're having trouble remember certain keyboard shortcuts you can, again, utilize
the command palette for this.
Example: Forgot what the code folding and unfolding commands were? Type fold and the
corresponding keyboard shortcut reference will be neatly displayed to the right of the search
results.
Snippets
Most of your snippets should have keyboard shortcut associated with them but
when you install a package with snippets, it can be hard to know what is available
without digging through GitHub repositories, wikis or docs. Use snip to filter
your snippets.
Practice
As previously mentioned, you can open the command palette by clicking on
Tools in the top menu and then selecting Command Palette . However, the
whole point of the command palette is to limit your use of the mouse. That known,
remembering the command palette keyboard shortcut is essential to being a
productive Sublime Text user.
30 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTake a moment to memorize and try out the command palette keyboard shortcut a
few times. ⌘ + Shift + p on OSX and Ctrl + Shift + p on Windows
and Linux. If you would rather use a different keyboard shortcut, check out Chapter
15.

Editor Settings & Customization
4.1 Settings Files
Customizing your text editor to exactly suit your needs is one of the best things you
can do for your productivity as a developer. Unlike most editors, there aren't fancy
GUI menus that allow you to pick and choose settings - there are settings files.
There are two types of settings files, both of which are formatted in JSON.
All settings files are located inside of the Sublime Text packages folder. It's
important to know where these files are so you can easily reference them. The
easiest way to open this folder is from the menu bar.
Preferences → Browse Packages... OSX users will find the Preferences option
under Sublime Text in the top left
In here there are quite a few different files and folders. The ones you use to
configure Sublime Text are usually found in the User folder - this is your folder
and will never be overwritten when you upgrade.
32 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserEverything from which font is being used and color schemes to the tab sizes and
ignored folders can all be set using custom editor preferences.
To find out what all the available settings are, you can take a look at the default file
by opening it up via Preferences → Settings - Default . This file is
only used as a reference. Setting custom preferences will override the settings in
this default file.
Note: The default settings file may look large but is worth reading through to get an idea of what
changes are possible to enhance your work flow.
*.sublime-settings Files
These files are where we specify all of our preferences. We will be doing most of
our customization in Preferences.sublime-settings which you can
bring up in the menu Preferences → Settings - User or by simply
hitting ⌘ + , on OSX.
There are a few types of settings files and the editor references them in this order:
1. Default Settings (do not edit this file)
◦ Packages/Default/Preferences.sublime-settings
2. Platform-Specific Settings (for those who jump between operating systems)
◦ Packages/Default/Preferences (<platform>).sublime-settings
3. User Settings (where we will make almost all of our edits)
◦ Packages/User/Preferences.sublime-settings
4. Syntax-Specific Default Settings (do not edit this file)
◦ Packages/<syntax>/<syntax>.sublime-settings
5. Syntax-Specific User Settings (for those who wish to have different settings per programming language)
◦ Packages/User/<syntax>.sublime-settings
33 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIf you open up your Preferences.sublime-settings (found in
Preferences → Settings - User ) you will see a blank settings file like
this:
// Settings in here override those in "Default/
Preferences.sublime-settings", and
// are overridden in turn by file type specific settings.
{
}
All of our settings will follow JSON syntax and look something like this:
{
"setting_name" : "Setting Value",
}
Syntax / Language Specific Settings
For some languages you may want different settings. For example, when editing
JavaScript files you might want to use spaces instead of tabs and turn off line
wrapping. On the other hand, when writing in Markdown, you still want hard tabs
and to see wrap lines. Instead of switching these settings between languages, you
can simply use the above reference order and create a new file called
/Packages/User/Markdown.sublime-settings . Inside you can put
the following:
{
"word_wrap": true,
"translate_tabs_to_spaces": false
}
34 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSettings Files JSON Gotchas
A few things to keep in mind if you are new to Sublime Text or JSON formatting in
general.
1. Use "double quotes" when defining both keys and string values (single quotes are not valid JSON).
2. Each key, value pair requires a comma between them
Example:
{
"setting_name" : true,
"another_setting" : 12,
"font_face": "inconsolata"
}
Note: Notice that the above JSON doesn't have a comma after the last line? You don't need one so
leave it out! This is one of the most common mistakes when editing JSON objects.
.sublime-keymap Files
Sublime and its packages come with some great maps for keyboard shortcuts.
These keymap files work very similarly to the settings hierarchy noted above. We'll
go into detail on how you can write your own shortcuts, using keymaps, later in
Chapter 15.
4.2 Syncing Your Settings
If you have multiple computers that run Sublime Text, you will want to have the
same settings and packages on both of them. The two most popular, and automatic,
ways to do this is either with Git or Dropbox.
35 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDropbox is the preferred method as it is done passively and automatically, whereas
Git requires actively pushing and pulling.
Each operating system has a different set of instructions which you can find on the
Package Control Website. At the end of the day, we essentially need to link the
folder on computer 1 to computer 2. Since Dropbox and Sublime Text are in
different folders, we can create a symlink (symbolic link) which will tie the Sublime
Text /Packages/User folder to our Dropbox folder.
It's important to note that we don't want to link the entire Packages/ or
Installed Packages/ directory as it contains the actual code for the
packages. We only want to sync the User/ folder which contains Package
Control.sublime-settings - the file that tells Package Control which
packages should be installed. Package Control will make sure to grab the correct
version of each package for your computer and install it.
By syncing the entire User/ folder, we also make sure the following user
preferences get moved over:
•
•
•
•
•
•
Your master settings file - Preferences.sublime-settings
Your language specific settings files - CSS.sublime-settings
Your custom snippets
Your custom build tasks
SFTP server information
And other package specific information and settings
4.3 Tabs, Spaces & Indentation
Specifying Tabs Or Spaces
By default, Sublime Text uses tab characters with a size of 4. If you prefer to use
spaces instead of a tab character, simply add this to your preferences file:
36 of 225
Sublime Text Power User"translate_tabs_to_spaces": true
You can also change the tab size or the number of spaces a tab takes up. It defaults
for 4 but I prefer to use 2
"tab_size": 2
Converting From Tabs → Spaces Or Spaces → Tabs
You will often run into a file or snippet of code that contains tabs or spacing that
isn't in tune with your preferred style. Rather than trying to reformat everything
manually, you can easily convert the file's spacing preference by doing the
following:
1.
2.
3.
4.
5.
Open the file
Open the Command Palette ( ⌘ + Shift + p )
Type spaces
Find Indentation: Convert to Spaces in the search results
Hit enter
This command will convert the entire document from tabs to spaces. Type tabs to
find the command to do the opposite.
37 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDetecting Indentation
You may have a personal preference between tabs and spaces, but not every project
will share that preference by default. Because of this, Sublime will attempt to detect
the tabs or spaces used. If you wish to turn this detection off, you can toggle this
following option in your settings file:
"detect_indentation": false
Detect Settings with Editor Config Package
Preferences such as tabs vs spaces and new lines at the end of files can vary from
project to project.
For instance, the jQuery Project uses a full tab character while Node uses 2
spaces. The editor config project is a package that is available for Sublime Text (as
well as all other major editors) which can help to bring some sanity to project-
specific formatting nuances. Project authors include a .editorconfig file in
the root of their project. When the Editor Config package is installed, it will detect
this file, read the config settings and update your Sublime Text settings to reflect
the project's preferences.
No more headaches keeping all of your team members or contributors on the same
page with formating!
Paste and Indent
One of the best tricks I've ever learned in Sublime Text is paste and indent. If you
have ever pulled a piece of code off the Internet and pasted it into your editor, you'll
no doubt feel the pain of having it paste in all weird leaving you to have to go in
and fix it.
38 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserEasy fix to this, instead of pressing the normal ⌘ + v to paste, is to simply switch
to using ⌘ + Shift + v to paste. This will automatically indent your code
block and switch it to your current use of tabs or spaces.
Like that one? I loved it so I remapped my key combos to paste and indent by
default on ⌘ + v
Paste this little snippet into your key bindings file located at Preferences →
Key Bindings - User
{ "keys": ["super+v"], "command": "paste_and_indent" },
{ "keys": ["super+shift+v"], "command": "paste" }
4.4 Fonts and Type Sizing
Picking a font is one of the most important parts of making your editor feel just
right. Sublime gives us very fine grain control over how text is displayed.
To change your font, simply set the value of "font_face" like so:
"font_face": "inconsolata"
Picking which font to use is a very personal thing. Some developers place
importance on fonts that have an italic style, while others are picky about the visual
difference between 0 and o or how the equals and open bracket make a fat arrow
=> .
I've personally hopped around and used a few in the past few years and I'm
currently between inconsolas and M+2m.
Here are a few of the best and most popular programming fonts.
39 of 225
Sublime Text Power User#### Consolas #### M+2m
#### inconsolata #### Menlo (sublime default)
40 of 225
Sublime Text Power User#### Monaco #### Ubuntu Mono
#### Adobe Source Code Pro #### ANONYMOUS PRO
41 of 225
Sublime Text Power User#### Dejavu Sans Mono
#### Envy Code R
#### Hermit
42 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTweaking Fonts
The first and most obvious thing you will want to do is change the font size:
"font_size": 16.0
You can also automatically add and change this value with CMD/CTRL + +/-
Another improvement I've made over Sublime Text's defaults is in increasing the
line height. This allows for greater readability.
"line_padding_bottom": 1,
"line_padding_top": 1,
Finally, there may be a few specific use-cases where you will need to specify some
of these font options, although they generally provide no benefit to the user.
"font_options": ["no_bold", "no_italic", "no_antialias",
"gray_antialias","subpixel_antialias", "no_round", "directwrite"],
4.5 Sidebar
If you are coming from another editor, chances are you will want to set up Sublime
Text very similar to how you used to have it. For me, having that trusty left hand
sidebar was mine. I like being able to see the folders and files for the projects I'm
working on.
By default, Sublime doesn't come with the sidebar to show open folders and files.
To turn this on, simply hit ⌘ + K , ⌘ + B (Windows and Linux users use
Ctrl ) or access it from the menu under view → Side Bar → Show
Side Bar
43 of 225
Sublime Text Power User4.6 Minimap
The minimap is something that I've never seen in a code editor before. It allows you
to view your code from 10,000 feet and works like a scrollbar on steroids.
Some love it and some hate it. Ultimately, it's just personal preference. Many
developers have said it's great as they can easily pick out comments or code blocks
without scrolling forever. This is especially helpful to Windows developers who
don't have inertial scrolling.
The minimap draws a block around the currently visible content. Depending on
your theme, you may want to add a border around that block with the following
setting.
"draw_minimap_border": true
As I write this book, I'm able to see my progression. I have the border turned on to
easily display where I'm currently at.

Code Completions and Intelligence
A big part of a text editor's job is staying a few steps ahead of you. That means
when writing code, it should start to suggest possible endings to help you speed up
your development.
5.1 Code Hinting / Auto Complete
Out of the box, Sublime Text does an okay job at making suggestions for what you
want to use. Auto complete is enabled by default, so there is no need to turn
anything on. As you type, Sublime will offer hints for possible completions. Take
this snippet of JavaScript for example:
var x = {
open_that_sucker_up : function() {
return 'bar';
}
}
Typing open_that_sucker_up would take a long time, so as I type
ope... , Sublime will suggest the completion of it. Hitting tab will auto
complete the function name.
45 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSublime will also suggest possible snippets that are associated with the current
language. In my example below, as I type for , Sublime will look through my
JavaScript snippets and suggest two of them:
If you find yourself in a situation where auto complete isn't opening, you can
trigger it manually with Ctrl + SPACE .
Where Auto Complete Fails
Auto complete isn't very smart so it will often suggest things that don't make any
sense. Take the following single line of JavaScript as an example:
var vancouver = "Vancouver, BC";
46 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserA simple variable string assignment we have all seen in any language before. Now
let's say I wanted to do something with vancouver so I start typing va... .
Up pops auto complete with three suggestions: var , vancouver , and
Vancouver .
First of all, I don't think I'd need to access var . Second, Vancouver
(capitalized) is only part of the string, so I won't ever need that. The one I'm after is
vancouver , which is in the middle of everything.
The problem compounds when snippets get in the way:
47 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSo, while the auto complete is good, there are better options available to speed up
your development time.
Settings
Want to tweak the way auto complete works? There are a few options that you can
set in any of your .sublime-settings files.
"auto_complete": false will turn off auto complete entirely. If you wish
to do this specifically for a language, keep it out of your general user settings and
place it in your language settings file. More on this available in the settings file.
"auto_complete_size_limit" allows to to set the threshold size of a file
where auto complete works. Larger files with auto complete can slow down your
editor so you may want to change this depending on how fast/slow your computer
is.
"auto_complete_delay" allows you to set a delay in milliseconds before it
opens. Want it right away as you type? Set it to 0. Want a 1 second wait? Set it to
1000.
"auto_complete_commit_on_tab" allows you to turn off the "tab to
select" functionality. Some developers want their tab key to insert a tab character,
so they turn this off.
If you are getting really custom with auto complete, you can also tweak the
selectors and triggers with auto_complete_selector and
auto_complete_triggers . For more information on these, view the Default
settings file available at Preferences → Settings - Default .

Sublime Text Power User5.2 SublimeCodeIntel
Sublime Code Intel is a package that provides smart completions. The package
provide support for all major languages including JavaScript, Mason, XBL, XUL,
RHTML, SCSS, Python, HTML, Ruby, Python3, XML, XSLT, Django, HTML5,
Perl, CSS, Twig, Less, Smarty, Node.js, Tcl, TemplateToolkit, PHP.
If you are using Sublime Text 2, go ahead and install it from Package Control. If
you are writing JavaScript, make sure to you have Node.js installed on your
computer. For those using Sublime Text 3, jump down to the end of the chapter and
read the steps to get it working.
Once installed, Sublime Code Intel will scan your projects and provide smart auto
completions to your code as it knows your structure of your application.
49 of 225
Sublime Text Power User5.3 Installing on ST3
For those using Sublime Text 3, the package has been ported over, but support and
ongoing development seems to be lacking. Thankfully, the package is stable and
working on Sublime Text, it just takes a bit of work to get it going.
Thanks to John Blackbourne for detailing the process on his blog at
https://johnblackbourn.com/sublimecodeintel-st3. I've based the below instructions
off of his findings:
50 of 225
Sublime Text Power User1. Use the development branch
Don't use the Package Control version of SublimeCodeIntel. Instead, use a Git
checkout of the development branch.
To do this, you will need knowledge of Git and a terminal window. In the Sublime
Text menu, go to Preferences → Browse Packages - this is the folder where you
will need to move to with your terminal window.
Once in that folder, type
git clone -b development git@github.com:SublimeCodeIntel/
SublimeCodeIntel.git
This will pull down the latest version of the code and switch to the development
branch.
2. Clear your CodeIntel cache
If you've had older versions of SublimeCodeIntel installed, your CodeIntel cache
probably needs clearing.
To do this, quit Sublime Text then go to your home directory and delete the entire
.codeintel directory (eg. on OS X this is at ~/.codeintel).
5.4 3. Fix the language-specific config
Inexplicably, SublimeCodeIntel’s default config disables project scanning for PHP
and JavaScript files, which is what most users have been using it for.
51 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTo fix it, open the Sublime Text menu and go to Preferences → Package
Settings → SublimeCodeIntel → Settings – Default . At the
bottom of this file are language-specific settings for Python, JavaScript, and PHP.
Do not edit this config directly. Instead copy its contents completely and paste it
into your user settings ( Preferences → Package Settings →
SublimeCodeIntel → Settings – User ). Then change the PHP and
JavaScript settings from the bottom of
codeintel_scan_files_in_project settings to true.
5.5 4. Be patient
When you first begin typing a function name or other entity that triggers CodeIntel,
the status bar will show you that the initial scan is taking place. I’ve noticed that
this status message disappears before scanning is actually complete, or it’ll state
that scanning is complete when it’s not. Be patient, and it will get there eventually.

Terminal and Command Line
Integration
6.1 OSX
If you work heavily in the command line, it's worth taking some time to both
implement the subl command as well as learn all of the available arguments
which will tightly knit your terminal environment and Sublime Text.
First, you need to link up the subl command. subl allows you to send files
from terminal to Sublime Text in a variety of ways. Open up your terminal window
and paste this little snippet in:
Sublime Text 2
ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text 2.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/
subl" ~/bin/subl
Sublime Text 3
53 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/SharedSupport/bin/
subl" ~/bin/subl
Having Trouble? Your mac may complain that there isn't a ~/bin folder. If this is the case, try
to run sudo ln -s "/Applications/Sublime Text.app/Contents/
SharedSupport/bin/subl" /bin/subl . This will both ask you for a password and
install it on your systems /bin folder rather than the current user.
If you wish to use another command in place of subl , just replace the last
instance of the word subl . I've seen some developers use slime instead.
6.2 Windows
If you are on a windows machine, fear not! There is an easy way to have similar
functionality.
Simply open up the command line ( start → run → ⌘ ) and paste the
following line:
Sublime Text 2
doskey subl="C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 2\sublime_text.exe" $*
54 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSublime Text 3
As of build 3065, Sublime Text now includes support to subl on windows.
subl.exe comes in the installation folder of Sublime Text - you must move it
over to your system path so it is available whenever you open the windows console.
While your install may vary, most windows computers will go something like this:
1. Copy subl.exe from C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3
2. Paste into C:\Windows\System32
6.3 Linux
If you are running Linux, chances are you already have this setup, but here is how
to do it should you need it. Pop these into your bash profile.
Sublime Text 2
alias subl='/usr/bin/sublime-text-2'
55 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSublime Text 3
alias subl='/usr/bin/sublime-text'
6.4 Using subl from the command line
The two most common use-cases are to:
Open any directory
subl ~/path/to/folder
Open the current directory
subl .
or a single file
subl index.js
We can also specify the line of a file
subl weather.js:50
And even the exact column if you are tracking down a pesky bug that is breaking
your script
subl routes.js:34:20
56 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserArguments
Sublime also allows us to pass a number of arguments to the subl command.
Let's take a look at all of them now:
- (std in)
This is super handy if you run scripts from the terminal and want to pipe the output
right into Sublime Text. Here is a quick demo:
When I press Ctrl + D to signal I'm done, it pipes the info into a temporary .txt
document
--project \:
57 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserLoad the given project
subl --project my-project.sublime-project
--command \:
Run the given command
subl --command css_tidy
-n or --new-window:
Sometimes you want to open a fresh window rather than add the file to the existing
project.
subl -n totallyDifferentFile.js
-a or --add:
Add the current file or folder to the active / last used sublime text window. I often
use this along with touch:
touch newFile.js
subl -a newFile.js
-w or --wait:
Waits for the files to be closed before returning. Helpful if you are writing to a file
and don't want to open a semi-finished file.
-b or --background:
58 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDon't bring Sublime Text into focus. Handy when you are opening several files one
after another.
-s or --stay:
Keep the application activated after closing the file.
-h or --help:
Show the help - modified version of this.
-v or --version:
Show version and exit
6.5 Terminal Package
On the other side of things, you can also go from Sublime to the terminal in one
easy step with Will Bond's Sublime Terminal package. It works on windows, linux
and mac.
If you are an OSX user, it will use the built-in terminal.app that comes with OSX.
However, you have the option of using iTerm2, which is a more feature-rich version
of terminal.app. To turn this on, set the following under Terminal Settings
- User (available in the command palette).
59 of 225
Sublime Text Power User{
"terminal": "iTerm.sh"
}
Once installed, you can either open a file's parent folder or a project's folder. The
quickest way is to use the keyboard shortcuts:
OSX:
• ⌘ + Shift + t to open the current file's parent directory in terminal
• ⌘ + Shift + Alt + t to open the current project directory in terminal
Windows & Linux:
• Ctrl + Shift + t to open the current file's parent directory in terminal
• Ctrl + Shift + Alt + t to open the current project directory in terminal
Commands are also available via the context menu by right clicking a file or folder
and selecting Open Terminal Here...

Maximizing Screen Real Estate with
Multiple Panes and Origami
If you work on a nice big monitor or keep a strict ~80 char width limit in your code,
you probably like to code with multiple panes of code open at once. Multiple panes
are particularly helpful when working with styles and templating at the same time.
Since CSS/LESS/Sass aren't very wide, having both panes open at once is an
option, even when on smaller screens.
Panes in Sublime are pretty straightforward. You can have up to four columns, up
to 3 rows, or a 2×2 grid of panes open at once. You can find all of these options
available under view → Layout
61 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserMenu-schmenu. We are efficient - let's learn the keyboard shortcuts for them.
OSX
⌘ + Option + [1-4] will split into 1-4 columns accordingly
⌘ + Option + 5 will give you a 4x4 grid
⌘ + Option + Shift + [2-3] will split into 2-3 rows accordingly
Windows and Linux
Alt + Shift + [1-4] will split into 1-4 columns accordingly
Alt + Shift + 5 will give you a 4x4 grid
Alt + Shift + [8-9] will split into 2-3 rows accordingly
62 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserPanes Exercise
Once you have your editor split into panes (note, Sublime calls these groups), we
can move focus from pane to pane. Let's give it a shot.
Start with a single pane and open up two different files. Focus the second file.
Now split the current window into two with the keyboard shortcut ⌘ + Option
+ 2 and focus the first tab with ⌘ + 1
63 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWhat we want to do now is switch the first tab over to the second pane without
touching our mouse.
Pressing Ctrl + Shift + 2 will move the current file to the second pane.
64 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserNow we want to make a new file, but in the first pane. First we need to focus the
first pane and then create a new file:
Ctrl + 1
⌘ + N
Try this 10 times over to get the hang of the shortcuts. Soon enough they will
become second nature.
65 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOrigami
The above may be enough for you, but if you rock a large 27" or 4k display and
have space to spare, you may wish to have a little more control over splitting up
your screen. Enter Origami, a package that makes this possible by allowing users to
split and resize panes into infinity. It also offers a nice set of commands for moving
files from pane to pane.
To install bring up the command palette with ⌘/CTRL + Shift + P and type
install.
After about two seconds you'll be prompted to type the name of the package. Go
ahead and search for origami and hit enter. It will take just a few seconds to install.
No need to restart.
Origami is simple, the functionality can be broken down into pane actions: create,
destroy, focus and file actions: move and clone.
66 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWindows and Linux Users: Replace ⌘ with Ctrl for the following keyboard commands
The Origami keyboard shortcuts are twofold, you must always press ⌘ + K
followed by the keyboard shortcut. At any time you can open the Goto Anything
palette ( ⌘ + P ) and type Origami to see all available commands and their
respective shortcuts.
Create
To create a pane to the right: ⌘ + K , ⌘ + → . Use this with any direction - ← , ↑ ,
→ or ↓
Note that it is not necessary to take your fingers off the ⌘ key when switching
between K and ← , ↑ , → or ↓
67 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDestroy
To destroy a pane, add Shift to the above keyboard shortcut. So, ⌘ + K , ⌘ +
Shift → would destroy the pane to the right.
Focus
Focusing a pane will allow you to create and view tabs within that pane. For this,
we just drop the ⌘ from the second keyboard shortcut. ⌘ + K , → will focus the
pane to the right.
Move
To move a file from one pane to another, we use the Shift key along with the
direction. ⌘ + K , Shift → would move the file to the right pane.
Of course, you can also just drag and drop your tabs from one pane to another.
Focus
Finally, the last option that Origami makes available to us is something I haven't
seen in a text editor before: Cloning. Cloning isn't a great name for it, it's more
"opening the same file twice without making a second copy". I guess that was too
long. Cloning a file allows you to open a mirror of the file and display it in another
pane - you can edit either file and both will be updated. This is helpful when you
want to reference the same file you are working on without having to scroll around
and lose your spot.
To use clone, we use the control key. ⌘ + K , control → would clone the
current file to the right pane.
68 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserResize
To resize your panes, simply drag an edge to the size that you desire. I like to use
Origami to have a small JavaScript REPL open at the bottom of my screen. (More
on Sublime REPL in the packages section).
7.1 Moving Between Tabs
OSX
Sublime is no different from most other programs with tabs (like Firefox or
Chrome). To move from tab to tab, you can use ⌘ + [1-9] to move to that
numbered tab, or the ⌘ + Option + ← or → to move to the previous/next tabs.
69 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWindows and Linux
Sublime is no different from most other programs with tabs (like Firefox or
Chrome). To move from tab to tab, you can use Alt + [1-9] to move to that
numbered tab, or the Ctrl + tab to move forward a tab, and Ctrl + Shift
+ tab to move to the previous tab.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 8
Working with Multiple Carets and
Selection
Note: The following section makes use of the ⌘ key. Windows and Linux users should replace ⌘ with Ctrl unless otherwise
specified.
A caret is the little blinking line that indicates where you are currently typing. This
is often mistakenly called a cursor, which is the little pointer or hand that tracks
where your mouse is located. In Sublime Text, we can have as many carets as we
want!
The simplest way to get started with multiple carets is to open a blank document,
add a few lines and then select each line by holding down ⌘ and clicking
wherever you wish to have an additional caret.
71 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserAlternatively you can also use the keyboard and use Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down
( Ctrl + Alt + Up/Down to windows) to add additional carets to the previous /
next lines.
Once you have selected multiple lines, you can then go ahead and type and see the
output for each line
That is really cool, but where is that useful?
8.1 Replacing Words
Let's take another example. Say we had a block of code and I needed to replace all
instances of the variable wes with alex .
72 of 225
Sublime Text Power Uservar wes = {};
wes.firstName = "wesley";
wes.lastName = "bos";
wes.status = "Cool guy";
if(!!wes.status.match(/cool/gi)) {
wes.score = 100;
}
else {
wes.score = 10;
}
There are a few ways to swap out every instance of wes . The first one that might
come to mind is a find/replace on just this selection - and you are right, we will
cover that in the searching and finding section of the book. For this exercise, we are
going to be using multiple selection to swap out every instance of wes .
To select all wes , we can hold down ⌘ and double-click everywhere there is an
instance of wes . We could also double click the first wes and then hit ⌘ + D
to incrementally select each instance — practice both because you will find
situations where you will use both.
73 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce you have them all selected, simply just type alex and you are done!
74 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserQuick Find Next / Quick Skip Next
Above we used ⌘ + D to select incrementally, which is great when everything
you are looking for is matched. However, sometimes you will need to skip over a
match and keep going.
For example, finding the word "wes" in the following list matches in "awesome"
and "western". To skip a match, first select it with ⌘ + D to move to it, then use
⌘ + K + D
75 of 225
Sublime Text Power User8.2 Modifying Multiple Lines at Once
Another case is when you have been given some HTML that looks like the snippet
below. Ideally we would never have to work with something like this, but we have
all come across something like this at some point:
We need to prefix each image with thumb- . Problem is, each image path is a
different length and editing them manually would take forever!
76 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserNever fear! The following steps will quickly get every line selected:
1. Click on the first line
2. While holding down ⌘ and Option
3. Drag your mouse through the rest of the lines
Note: Windows and Linux users should use Ctrl + Shift + right-drag
You should now have a cursor somewhere on each line.
Again, use ⌘ + ← ( Alt + ← for win/linux) to bring all cursors to the front of
the line, and then we will hold down Option / Alt while using our arrow
keys to jump by word. When in front of the file name, simply type thumb-
77 of 225
Sublime Text Power User8.3 Another Multi-caret Example
To show how awesome multiple carets are, let's take a look at some text that you
may get in an email that we need to convert to HTML.
1.
2.
3.
4.
Go to the store.
Buy some apples.
Peel those apples.
Bake me a pie.
We need to convert this list to a legit ordered list. So our steps are:
1.
2.
3.
4.
Remove the 1,2,3 and 4 and trailing period which are typed as text.
Wrap each line with a list item <li> and </li>
Wrap all the lines in an unordered list <ul> and </ul>
Indent the list items
We could just do this manually. It might take a few minutes to wrap and indent, but
since we are essentially doing the same thing 4 times — once for each line — we
can use multiple carets and manage each line at the same time.
The first step is to get a caret on each line. In Sublime, hold down ⌘ and click
wherever you wish to place a caret. You can also use the keyboard and use
Ctrl + Shift + Up/Down to select lines.
78 of 225
Sublime Text Power User⌘ + ← to get and bring all cursors to the front of the lines. Then hold down
Shift and select the first three characters.
Type <li> in front of the content, hop to the end of the lines with ⌘ + → and
finish it off with a closing </li> . (Note: We will learn how to do this even faster
with tag wrapping later in the book).
While you still have each line selected, use ⌘ + ] to indent all the lines.
Finally, head to the top of the document with ⌘ + ↑ and type <ul> doing the
opposite for the </ul> at the end.

Themes and Color Schemes
Themes and color schemes are one of my favorite parts of Sublime Text. As
developers, we stare at our screen for 8+ hours a day, so it is important to spend
some time evaluating our options and customizing the editor visuals to our liking. If
you are still using the default colours that came with Sublime when you installed it,
it's time to switch!
9.1 Color Schemes
Color Schemes define what color your code shows up in. Background color, font
style and colors for things like comments, functions, arguments, scope and brackets
are all defined inside the color scheme.
80 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSince Sublime Text is a relatively new editor, the author has created it to be able to
use TextMate theme files ( .tmTheme ), which has been around for years and has
many themes available. You can see a list of available color schemes by going to
Preferences → Color Scheme . These files are also located in
/Packages/Color Scheme - Default . Switching a theme from the
menu will automatically update your Preferences.sublime-settings
file but you can code in the path like so if you please:
"color_scheme": "Packages/Theme - Cobalt2/cobalt2.tmTheme"
81 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserColor Scheme Selector Package
An even easier way to jump between multiple color schemes is to install the color
scheme selector package. This will allow you change and preview color schemes
right from the command palette.
Want to use two different themes for different programming languages? Easy, just set the "color_scheme" to whatever theme you want to use
in /Packages/User/[syntax].sublime-settings . Here I have set the following in /Packages/User/CSS.sublime-
settings "color_scheme": "Packages/Color Scheme - Default/Solarized (Light).tmTheme" It overrides the default of "color_scheme":
"Packages/Theme - Cobalt2/cobalt2.tmTheme"
82 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe best part about color schemes is that they are just XML, which means you are
free to crack open your color scheme and edit it to your liking. To create your own
theme, I recommend starting from an existing color scheme that is similar to how
you enjoy coding. It's a good idea not to edit the existing .thTheme file inside
the previously mentioned folder - you will run this risk of having this overwritten
with future updates to Sublime Text. Instead copy the .thTheme file into your
/Packages/User folder and rename it to something like
myTheme.tmTheme .
Finally, it's a good idea to replace the following six lines with a little bit about your
theme.
83 of 225
Sublime Text Power User<key>author</key>
<string>Wes Bos</string>
<key>comment</key>
<string>Tweaked and refined Sublime Text theme based on the original
cobalt</string>
<key>name</key>
<string>cobalt2</string>
Sublime text monitors the Packages folder for any file changes. So, like your
user settings, any change to a theme file will automatically be reflected upon each
save, this makes editing color schemes a breeze!
9.2 Themes
Themes are something that are totally unique to Sublime Text. Themes control how
the actual chrome of the editor looks. Things like the tabs, sidebar, search bar and
buttons are all controlled with a theme. Themes are made up of JSON
.sublime-theme files which include settings for width/height pixel sizes,
opacity values, RGB color values and paths to images.
The first theme past the default one Sublime Text comes with, Soda Theme, was
done by the talented Ian Hill of Buy Me a Soda. This theme includes entirely
redone icons and took a slimmer approach to tabs.
I've also created one based on the Soda Theme, with the help of Kyle Knight, to go
along with my Cobalt2 theme. Either the Soda theme or Cobalt2 are a huge
improvement on the default Sublime Text UI. I'd like to encourage you to fork one
of these themes and tweak it until it's just right.

Sublime Text Power User9.3 Finding Themes and Color Schemes
Themes can be found all over the net. If you aren't happy with one of the
prepackaged ones, take a look at the following resources to find a theme that suits
your fancy.

Handy Tools
For a more visual approach to editing your theme, there is a fantastic tool created
by Allen Bargi that lets you visually edit your color scheme.
The entire thing is open source and written in HTML5 with Node.js on the back-
end, so you can run your own version and improve upon it. Code available at
https://github.com/aziz/tmTheme-Editor

Snippets
Snippets are small (or large), predefined pieces of code that you use repeatedly to
speed up development productivity. If you find yourself writing the same or at least
similar code over and over, you may wish to create or source a snippet to make that
faster.
At their simplest, snippets consist of a tab trigger that opens up into a larger
piece of code. Snippets can be peppered with placeholders which let you set
defaults and spots which you can tab through to.
10.1 Creating Snippets
To create a new snippet, go to Tools → New Snippet... and you will see
the snippet boiler place which is just a little XML. By default most of it is
commented out, but let's uncomment the snippet and step through each part.
<snippet>
<content><![CDATA[
I ${1:love} to make ${2:snippets!}.${3}
]]></content>
<tabTrigger>hello</tabTrigger>
<scope>source.python</scope>
87 of 225
Sublime Text Power User<description>A sample snippet</description>
</snippet>
Content
The content is the code that will show when the snippet is triggered. Because
snippets are XML, they need to be inside of <![CDATA[ and ]]> in order for
them to work properly. Inside these tags, you can paste whatever code, in whatever
language, you wish.
Snippets can be peppered with placeholders which let you set defaults and
spots which you can tab through to. Placeholders are noted with ${1} where the
number is the order in which you tab through. We can also set the default text with
a similar syntax of ${1:default text for this placeholder}
Placeholders can also be used multiple times within a snippet. This is helpful when
you need to type the same variable name a few times, such as in a JavaScript for
loop:
var len = myArr.length;
for (var i=0; i<len; i++) {
console.log(myArr[i]);
}
Chances are you may want to use the variables len , myArr , and i , but if you
don't, you can just tab through and change them all at once!
88 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTab Trigger
We have already learned that all the snippets are available through the GoTo
Anything menu, and this is a good way to find a snippet that you don't use very
often.
89 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFor more frequently used snippets, you should assign a tab trigger that allows you
to type and expand on the go.
For the above javascript snippet, I assigned the tab trigger of jsfor . Now, when I
wish to use that snippet, I simply type jsfor followed by the tab key to expand.
<tabTrigger>jsfor</tabTrigger>
Snippet Scope
You may be wondering why I had to call my last snippet jsfor instead of just
for . What happens when we have a for loop snippet for JavaScript but we also
want one for use in python?
Well, I could have just called it for and assigned a scope to it. Setting the scope
as source.js will expose this snippet to you only when editing JavaScript files
or writing JavaScript within <script></script> tags.
The scopes are sometimes hard to pin down and they aren't always as clear as
scope.js .
If you are having trouble finding the scope, an easy way to find it is to open your
packages folder Preferences → Browse Packages... and find the folder
associated with your language. Inside of that folder will be a .tmLanguage file.
Open it and search for scope . You will find a line that looks similar to this,
revealing what the scope name for that language is.
<key>scopeName</key>
<string>source.css.less</string>
90 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDescription
The description is pretty straightforward. If specified, the description will show up
in the command palette. When not specified, the filename is used. I recommend
using keywords so it's easy to reference your snippet in the command palette.
I use the fancy Unicode arrow → quite a bit in this book so I've made a simple
snippet for it, giving it a keyword description and an easy tab trigger of >>
<snippet>
<content><![CDATA[
→
]]></content>
<tabTrigger>>></tabTrigger>
<description>→ Fancy Unicode Arrow</description>
</snippet>
Saving
Finally, when it comes to saving your snippets, you can put them anywhere in your
packages folder. If your snippets are part of a package you are developing, keep
them within your package, otherwise I like to create a folder called snippets
inside of my User folder.
91 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSnippets are the file type .sublime-snippet , so make sure you append that
onto the end, as sublime doesn't assume you are saving a snippet
10.2 Finding Snippets
The are loads of snippets online for your enjoyment, and I encourage you to go out
and find a set that meets your type of development.
The best spot to find snippets is in Package Control. You can browse right inside
the editor by typing "Install" into the command palette and searching for "snippet",
or browse the online community directory located at Will Bond's website
92 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserYou can also find snippets by doing a search on github. The new search feature lets
us filter for files or repos that include .sublime-snippet files.
https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=jquery+extension%3A.sublime-

Efficient Searching, Finding and
Replacing
Search and replace you say? Does this even need to be mentioned, let alone an
entire chapter in this book?!
Yes, yes it does! The search functionality within Sublime Text is both very
powerful and extensive. It isn't exactly clear how to use everything and I often talk
to people who are confused about its functionality. So, let's dive in and get a better
understanding.
For this section's examples, I'm going to use a piece of JavaScript that has the word
"wes" multiple times throughout it.
var wes = {};
wes.firstName = "Wesley";
wes.lastName = "Bos";
wes.status = "Cool awesome guy";
if(!!wes.status.match(/cool/gi)) {
wes.score = 100;
}
else {
94 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userwes.score = 10;
}
Here is a quick visual on all the instances of the three characters w , e , and s in a
row.
11.1 Searching Inside of a Document
Keyboard shortcut Cmd/Ctrl + F will open the most basic of search panes at
the bottom of the editor where you can then type in your search. If you have a word
selected at the time you hit Cmd/Ctrl + F , that phrase will be auto-populated
into the search box.
To cycle through search results you can either keep hitting the enter key or use
Cmd/Ctrl + G . If you go too far, adding Shift to either of these key combos
will reverse your direction.
95 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce you have found your match and you want to "get off the ride" and start
editing your document, simply hit the esc key and the editor will return to your
document with your search term highlighted.
11.2 Search Options
There are a number of options available when you are searching. Most of these are
fairly self-explanatory, but I will run though them just for reference sake:
Regex Search
Rather than just matching a string, there are times that you will need to match a
bunch of content that can only be accomplished with a regular expression. If I flip
on this setting, I'm able to search against any regex within my document.
You may have a document where the author went whitespace crazy, instead of
manually going through each line and deleting them, I can do a search for lines that
start with newlines — ^\n
96 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserAnother example would be searching for multiple attributes that are set in a certain
way. For example, all classes or IDs set to food would be matched with
(class|id)="food"
97 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIf you are new to regular expressions, I recommend using the regexr and regexpr
tools to help you learn and get yourself up to speed.
Case Sensitive
Do you want the search to ignore the case of a word? For example a search for
Wes matches wes , WES , wES and so on. If so, leave it off.
Whole Word
Do you want to match partial words? For example if I search for text , should it
match the last four letters of sublimeText ?
Show Context
When show context is turned on, the search results will include the previous two
lines of code and the next two lines of code for a total of 5 LOC. This is helpful in
understanding the context of a variable but can make your search results very long.
When it is turned off, the results only display the line with the match.
98 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIn Selection
When enabled, Sublime will limit the scope of the search to the currently selected
text. This is useful when you are looking to find all instances of a variable within a
certain selected area.
Wrap
When searching within a document, the first selected result will be the one that
comes first after the caret. When wrap is turned on and the last result in the
document is tabbed through, the search will start again at the top of the document,
essentially wrapping around.
Highlight Matches
When turned on, the editor will circle, or highlight, all of the matches with an
outline. The currently selected one will be filled in with that color.
Use Buffer
When searching inside an entire project, the default of Sublime will open it in a
small panel at the bottom of the editor. With use buffer turned on, search results
will open in a new tab, or as Sublime sometimes calls it, a buffer.
11.3 Search & Replace Inside Projects and Folders
After the last section, searching inside a single document should be a piece of cake,
but what about when you want to search across an entire folder or project?
99 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserCmd/Ctrl + Shift + F will bring up an extended panel that allows for this
extended searching.
Using the find button here will open a new pane that lists the results that were
found. You are then able to click on these results to open the corresponding file and
location.
The important field here is the where input. By default it will search all open files
and folders. So, if you have a project open it will search the entire folder, or if you
have dragged several files/folders into a Sublime window, the scope is limited to all
those files/folders.
Now if you want to limit the scope of your search, we have a few options:
Specific Folders — Multiple absolute folder paths each separated by a comma.
Helpful for when you are doing a find/replace on multiple similar codebases.
100 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserProject — Similar to the default, you can search the current project by entering
<project> into the where input.
Include Filter — Limit your search to a specific file, file type, or file name. Here
you can enter a full file name index.js , and then use an asterisk to wildcard a
file type or name. Examples of this include:
*.js — all .js files
index.* — index.html, index.js, index.php, etc...
page-*.* — page-home.html, page-about.php, etc...
Exclude Filter — Same as above, but append a minus sign - before the search.
Examples of this include:
*.js, -*.min.js — all but minified .js files
index.* , -*.js — all index files except index.js
page-*.*, -*admin* — page-[anything].[anything] except files with admin
in the name.
open folders — <open folders> will set the scope to open folders and not
include any other currently open windows.
open files — <open files> will set the scope to currently open files and not
include any currently open folders.
101 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserCombining Filters
All of the above filters can be stacked together by separating them with a comma.
Putting multiple where inputs will evaluate files to match one or more match — not
all of them. Make sure to use the minus operator - to exclude files from search.
11.4 Incremental Find
Another great feature of Sublime's search is the incremental find which allows you
to combine multiple carets and search into a multi-select based on your search term.
For more on this, using this same example, read the section on multiple carets.
11.5 Other Searching Tips
Just like a terminal environment, pressing your keyboard's up arrow in the search
field will allow you to cycle through your previous searches.
102 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 12
Moving, Selecting, Expanding and
Wrapping
This section is filled with tips that will make you say "Ah! I didn't know you could
do that!". Little tricks that will help with everyday coding tasks. This is where
Sublime really starts to shine.
12.1 Line Bubbling / Swapping
Line Bubbling is one of my favorite parts of Sublime Text. It allows you to easily
move sections of code up or down through your document without having to cut
and paste.
To use line bubbling, hold down ⌘ + Ctrl ( Ctrl + Shift on Windows)
and use your ↑ up and ↓ down arrow keys to move the lines around. This works
for single and multiple lines.
103 of 225
Sublime Text Power User12.2 Reindenting Code Blocks
Now, if for some reason you end up with either a block of code or an entire file
filled with hard to read, messy and poorly indented code, reindent will be your best
friend.
To automatically re-indent your code, simply select the code you want to indent and
then from the menu Edit → Line → Reindent
Sublime doesn't ship a keyboard shortcut for this by default. No problem, we can
make our own. Pop this little snippet into the Preferences → Key
Bindings - User file.
{ "keys": ["super+shift+r"],
"command": "reindent" }
For more on indentation, refer to the tabs vs spaces section of this book.
12.3 Joining
Joining two lines together is something developers do all the time. I often see users
just hitting the backspace key until the line below jumps up onto a single line.
To join lines, place your cursor on the top line and hit ⌘ ( Ctrl for windows/
Linux) + J . Remember J for join.
This also works with multiple cursors, you can bring everything onto a single line
extremely quickly.
104 of 225
Sublime Text Power User12.4 Duplicating
Need to duplicate a line of code? Chances are you are may be currently using this
method:
1. Selecting the entire line with your mouse
2. Copy via ⌘ + C
3. Paste via ⌘ + V
That is too much work! Duplicate lines quickly with ⌘ + Shift + D or Ctrl
+ Shift + D for Windows/Linux users.
12.5 Deleting
No longer need a line? Similar the one above, save yourself the manual work and
delete lines with one quick key combo of Ctrl + Shift + K .
Using Ctrl + K without the shift key will delete from the caret to the end of the
current line.
⌘ + backspace will delete from the caret to the beginning of the current line.
Side note: ⌘ + X will cut the current line without having to select it. Handy if you need to paste
somewhere else.
Deleting Words
Deleting words seems easy, right? Select a word with your mouse and hit the
backspace. Or maybe you have figured out how to select word-by-word and then
hit delete. We have even easier ways to do this.
Backspace word-by-word with Ctrl + backspace .
105 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserForward delete word-by-word with Ctrl + fn + backspace or Ctrl +
Del on windows.
Deleting Letters
Backspace obviously removes one letter at a time.
fn + backspace does a forward delete. Or just the delete key on windows.
12.6 Inserting a Line Before
Need a new line? Enter works just great if your cursor is at the end of the line,
but if your cursor is in the middle of a line you can use ⌘ + Enter and ⌘ +
Shift + Enter to add lines after and before the current lines respectively.
Windows and Linux users swap ⌘ with Ctrl .
This is especially helpful because you do not need to be at the end or the start of a
line for it to work - your cursor can be anywhere inside the current line and it will
jump above/below without disrupting the current line.
12.7 Wrapping with Tags
We will learn all about Emmet, which will help you code HTML tags much faster,
among many other things, but what if you already have content that needs to be
marked up in HTML?
Well, Sublime comes with an extremely handy "wrap with tags" functionality. To
use it, simply select the text you wish to wrap with tags, and hit Ctrl (Alt on
Windows) + Shift + W . This is also accessible via the menu under Edit →
Tag → Wrap selection with tag .
106 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserBy default, Sublime will wrap your content in a paragraph p tag.
Type any tag name and both the opening and closing tag will be updated:
You can even continue adding attributes without de-selecting the closing tag. Just
press space and keep typing!
12.8 Jump to BOL or EOL
Jump to the beginning / end of line in Sublime Text is simply ⌘ + →/← .
If you wish to select text as well, add Shift to the above combination.
You may have noticed that if you have line wrapping on, Sublime only brings you
to the visual EOL/BOL, not the hard EOL/BOL. So, if you are trying to select an
entire paragraph, it only grabs the top line:
107 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSometimes this is the desired outcome, but when you wish to select the entire line,
simply hit your arrow key twice.
⌘ + → + → to jump to hard end of line
⌘ + Shift + → + → to select to hard end of line
Windows/Linux Users replace ⌘ with Ctrl + Shift . You may be rolling your eyes at this tip because you have the almighty end
key on your keyboard.
12.9 Moving to Ends and Starts of Lines and Files.
Jumping or selecting an entire file works just the same, but instead using the ↑ and
↓ arrows.
⌘ + ↓ to jump to end of file
⌘ + Shift + ↓ to select to end of file
12.10 Selecting, Jumping & Expanding
Selecting text and expanding your selection is a large part of making your work
flow as efficient as possible. Every time you reach for your mouse to select a
segment of text, you are slowing yourself down.
Most text selections are things you do over and over, so it is worth figuring out how
we can do it with just a few keystrokes. Let's take a look at the many ways to select
and expand your text.
Windows and Linux users, when unspecified, replace ⌘ with Ctrl .
108 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserJump by Word
Let's start things off easy: jumping around by word. Instead of grabbing your
mouse, we can use Alt + → to jump by word. This is great when you wish to get
a few words over - try to use this instead of mousing over.
Do this over and over until you are comfortable with the keyboard shortcut.
Select & Expand Word by Word
Now let's say you want to select a few of these words as you move along. Simply
add in Shift to the mix to select and jump by word.
Alt + Shift + →
Select & Expand to Certain Words
Selecting a word comes in handy when you want to replace multiple occurrences of
a word in a file, but do not want to use the potentially destructive find and replace.
To select a word, make sure your caret is somewhere inside that word and hit ⌘ +
D . Hitting it multiple times will select the next occurrences of that word.
You can then go ahead and perform any number of operations on the selection, such
as wrapping them with a tag:
109 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserLike this? Read more on this feature in Chapter 11.
Jump by Line
To jump to the beginning or the end of a line in Sublime Text we use ⌘ + ←/→ .
Windows users can use the Home / End key in place of this.
Select & Expand to Line
Selecting an entire line is easy. We can use the technique stated above with ⌘ +
Shift + → + → or simply use ⌘ + L to select the entire line.
If you have word wrapping on, you may find yourself in the situation where ⌘ +
Shift + → only selects the first visible line and not the entire line:
To remedy this, press the → key a second time to select to the real end of line. So,
⌘ + Shift + → + → .
Using ⌘ + L or Shift + ↓ multiple times will add the next line(s) to your
selection. Use Shift + ↑ to select lines above the current selection.
110 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSelect & Expand to Tag
This one is similar to wrap in tag, but the opposite. Need to select all text inside a
tag? Hit Shift + ⌘ + a .
Using Shift + ⌘ + a again will select the tag as well, useful if you are
working with nested tags.
Once more will select all sibling tabs and any content inside the parent.
Select & Expand to Brackets
Not writing HTML? No problem, this one will select to brackets for languages that
are based on brackets.
Ctrl + Shift + M will select to your square and curly brackets. As always,
doing it a few times will select up multiple levels.
111 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSelect & Expand to Indent
Using a language based on indentation such as Python, Slim or HAML? Just want
to select an entire block of indented code? Not to fear, Sublime has fantastic
indentation detection built in.
⌘ + Shift + J will select your indented block. You can also use this in
conjunction with brackets. For example, in CSS if I wanted to select everything but
the selector and curly braces:
Note: If you are in Sublime Text 3, the keyboard shortcut was disabled in version 3. If you wish to
have it back, add the following code to your key bindings file located at Preferences →
Key Bindings - User . { "keys": ["super+shift+j"], "command":
"expand_selection", "args": {"to": "indentation"} }
Select & Expand to Quotes
This is one that isn't built right into Sublime Text but is incredibly helpful,
especially when dealing with HTML attributes or string variables.
112 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThis one comes in the form of a package. To install, simply open up Package
Control and search for the "Select Quoted" package. It is available for both ST2 and
ST3.
Simply hit Ctrl + ' . Easy to remember because you want to control the quotes.
Once more will include the quotation in the selection:
Selection and Beyond!
By this stage, you get the point. There are many ways to select your text. There are
a few more available under the Selection menu. Use this as a reference for
remembering the keyboard shortcuts and take some time to get comfortable with
the different types of selection.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 13
Code Folding
When working with large documents, it is helpful to fold sections of the code so it
is not visible. Code folding in Sublime Text takes sections of your code and
minimizes it into a single character.
The best way to get comfortable with code folding is to try it out. For this chapter,
open up Sublime Text and follow along with the code below.
13.1 Practice Code
Code folding works in all languages. I've created a small snippet of JavaScript
which we can use to practice. Copy and paste this into Sublime and set the
document mode as JavaScript.
var obj = {
myStr: "Hello",
myFunc : function() {
console.log("hello");
$('.someDiv').animate({height: 500}, function(){}
// trigger the callback
console.log('Done');
});
},
114 of 225
Sublime Text Power UsermyFunc2 : function() {
return "Just another Level 2 function";
},
myNum : function() {
return "Level 2 function";
}
}
13.2 Folding Selected Text
The simplest form of code folding is more of code compressing because it has
nothing to do with the indentation. Go ahead and select a few lines of code and type
⌘ + Option + [ (Windows users use Ctrl + Shift ). You'll now see you
have a little icon indicating you have folded some code.
To unfold the code, repeat the above key combo with the closing square bracket —
] .
Block Level Code Folding
Selecting the code you want to fold can be a pain. If you maintain nice, clean
indentation within your document, you'll be able to quickly fold and unfold several
levels of code in just a few key strokes.
To fold a block, place your cursor anywhere within the block you want to fold. For
our example, lets place it in the myFunc function. Now you just hit the same keys
as before and Sublime will detect the nearest block level and fold it for you.
115 of 225
Sublime Text Power User13.3 Fold Multiple Blocks at Once
Another handy feature of folding is being able to fold all blocks that are indented
with a certain level. For this example, I want to fold all of them and just see the
properties/functions of obj .
The keyboard shortcut for this is a little different. We need to hold down ⌘ (Ctrl
on Windows/Linux) and then tap K .
While you are still holding down ⌘ or Ctrl tap the level of code block you
want to fold. In this case 2.
Confused? ⌘ + K , ⌘ + 2
We now see that everything beyond 2nd level blocks are hidden. To unfold
everything again, we do the same thing but with 0.
13.4 Folding with Arrows
Another, somewhat new, feature to Sublime Text is the code folding arrows that
show up in the gutter of the editor. They allow you to fold your code based on the
indentation by clicking the arrow.
116 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWhile they are fairly straightforward to use, the default setting of Sublime Text will
only show them on hover. To make them visible all the time, you can use the
following setting in your Preference.sublime-settings file.
"fade_fold_buttons": false
13.5 Folding Element Attributes
117 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWhen working with an HTML document that is heavy on attributes, it can be
helpful to hide everything but the element type. This is extremely useful when
working with something like jQuery UI or Angular that have long element
attributes,class names, titles, data, and aria attributes. Now, this one is all or
nothing, so you can't hide them case-by-case.
To hide:
⌘ + K , ⌘ + T
To show again:
⌘ + K , ⌘ + 0
13.6 Maintaining Folding State
If you close and re-open a file, you will notice that all of your folds have
disappeared. This is frustrating when you spend lots of time folding your file. There
is a package called BufferScroll that maintains the state of your code folds even
after you close files or the editor. Read more about this package and its many useful
features in Chapter 24.

Projects
Projects in Sublime Text are a nice way to manage different websites or
applications that you may be working on. The main benefit to using projects in
Sublime Text is the ability to have specific editor settings that apply only to that
specific project. This is especially helpful when working with teams who may not
have their editor setup properly for contributing.
There are two files that make up a Sublime Text project: the .sublime-
project file and the .sublime-workspace file. The first being a file to
hold your project's settings and the second being a place where the editor can dump
user specific data. If you were to open the .sublime-workspace file, you
would see all kinds of things from previously opened files to editor settings. You
will never need to edit this file, so it's best just to ignore it.
When working with version control, the .sublime-project file should be
checked in and shared while the .sublime-workspace file should not. I find
it helpful to get myself into the habit of adding .sublime-workspace to all
my .gitignore files.

Sublime Text Power User14.1 .sublime-project file makeup
The .sublime-project file is, just like all other settings files in Sublime
Text, a JSON formatted file. Inside of the file are stored settings that make up the
three main functions.
1. Folder Settings
Perhaps the most obvious, the folders setting tracks which folders are included
in the project. This means that you are able to include multiple folders from all over
your system while using absolute file paths.
If you are using absolute file paths, you do not need to house the file in your
projects root directory. The .sublime-project file can live anywhere you
please. The downside to this is that sharing the .sublime-project file with
team members won't really work unless you have identical file systems.
If you do keep the .sublime-project folder in the root directory of your
project, you are able to use relative file paths.
120 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe above file, I have this Book's project open.
1. In the first path I include the entire book folder.
2. In the second path, I've "pinned" a nested CSS folder that I access regularly. Even though the css
folder is inside the first 0185-book folder, I'm able to the use dot-forward slash ./ to access
relative file paths.
3. In the third path, I'm able to navigate one folder up to my main websites folder where I house all my
coding demos. To do this we use the two dots and a forward slash ../
Taking it even further, there are a number of settings you can use to fine tune your
folder list in the sidebar.
"name" allows you to rename each of these paths to a more user friendly name.
In the example below I've renamed my book's folder to "Sublime Text Power User"
"follow_symlinks": true is set automatically when adding a folder to a
project. If you even need to set that to false, it's there.
"file_exclude_patterns" and "folder_exclude_patterns"
work just as they normally do but are constrained to the current folder. Many of
these files/folders can be ignored at a global level, but this will be helpful when you
want fine grain control over which files and folders you are ignoring.
121 of 225
Sublime Text Power User2. Settings Overwrite
Settings are exactly the same as the ones found in the your .sublime-
settings files. If you add settings to your .sublime-project file, they
will overwrite any settings you have previously set. This is extremely helpful for
code quality settings such as tabs-vs-spaces or linting rules, which can often differ
from one project to another.
In terms of specificity, syntax specific settings will always overwrite project
specific settings.
3. Build Systems
Here you are able to add build systems that are specific to this project. For more
information on build systems, make sure to cover the Build Systems section of this
book.
122 of 225
Sublime Text Power User14.2 Creating and Updating Projects
Every time you open a blank window in Sublime you are essentially creating a new
project. However, to maintain your folders, settings and build system you must save
the project into a .sublime-project file. Once you have opened at least one
folder with Sublime, you can save it via Project → Save Project
As...
To add a folder to your current project, simply drag and drop the folder into the
sidebar. You are also able to access this via the Project menu.
To remove a folder, edit the file manually or use the context menu when right
clicking on the folder.

Mastering Keyboard Shortcuts
Using the keyboard is far superior to using a mouse in almost all ways. Whether
you are new to coding or have been around for a long time, there are many benefits
to re/training yourself to learn on the keyboard:
15.1 Negating Carpel Tunnel
I'm not a doctor, but I can tell you I had a really bad RSI / carpel tunnel problem.
Moving your hand with a mouse for 8+ hours a day isn't great for you. The less you
move your arms, the better.
15.2 Reducing Mistakes
We are all human, and we all make stupid mistakes. Developers are error prone.
The less we rely on typing out entire strings of code, the less errors we will make.
We have all spent 30+ mins on a problem that turned out to be a simple syntax error
or spelling mistake - let's stop doing that!
Spelling Mistakes
124 of 225
Sublime Text Power User<img scr="dog.jpg">
Improper Syntax
<a href"about.html">About ME</a>
Nesting Troubles
<p>Hello <em>world</p></em>
Forgetfulness
.wrapper {
float:left;
width:100%
color:blue;
}
The above are all things we have done before in whatever language we are using.
Can we cut down on them with keyboard shortcuts? Absolutely!
15.3 Becoming a More Efficient Coder
Finally, the most obvious one is that using keyboard shortcuts can really speed up
development time.
Replacing a 10 second task with a 2 second task may not seem like a huge
improvement - what is 8 seconds saved? Over the course of a week, you can save
yourself hours of unnecessary grunt work. Improve your productivity by just 30
minutes a day and you can add an extra three weeks onto each year.
125 of 225
Sublime Text Power User15.4 The Process of Becoming a Keyboard Shortcut Master
Becoming a keyboard shortcut master doesn't come overnight, you need to change
the way that you work and break old habits. In most cases, you will actually slow
yourself down for the first few times you use a shortcut. This is okay, you are
breaking and re-forming new habits that will save you tons of time in the future.
The rule of thumb that I tell people is that when you do something that feels
inefficient twice, stop and figure out how you should be doing it. This will be
annoying at first because instead of doing it the 10 second way that you are used to,
you need to stop and spend upwards of a minute finding and remembering the
correct keyboard shortcut. This is all part of the re-training process. After a few
times of being slow, you will commit the shortcut to muscle memory and
everything will be high-fives and sunny from there on out.
15.5 Referencing Shortcuts
If and when you forget what the keyboard shortcut is, always remember that almost
every command is also available to you via the command palette or the Sublime
Text menu.
This means that you can pop open the command palette or the menu at any time to
find the command you are looking for. While you are there, don't just click the
command you want, take note how most commands have a keyboard shortcut right
next to it.
126 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce you have done this a few times, you will start to commit the shortcut to
memory and things will start to move much faster for you!
127 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThere is also a fantastic package called Keymaps which takes inventory of both
native commands and ones introduced by packages compiling a list and cheat sheet
of all available key maps.
15.6 What the Heck are the ⌃⇧⌘⌥? + SUPER Keys!?
One of the most frustrating things for keyboard shortcut newbies and pros alike is
looking at an image like the one in the last section and trying to remember what
⌃⇧⌘⌥ and SUPER are.
128 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSpending some time to commit these to memory will greatly improve your quality
of life. Each one comes with a really silly way to remember.
⌃
The Control or Ctrl key.
Think of it as a button on a game controller. You use the up arrow to control where
your character in the game goes.
Everyone calls this a hat. Think of it as a hat that someone in power, or control
would wear. A mad crazy controllers hat.
⇧
The Shift key. Most Windows keyboards have this symbol on it, but Mac users
aren't as lucky. We usually use Shift to make a Capital Letter. So the up icon is the
one we use to create uppercase letters.
⌘ / Super / ÿ
Most shortcuts will refer to something called a SUPER key.
On Mac, this is the Command, or ⌘ key.
On Windows, this is the Windows key ÿ
On Linux, it will differ depending on your OS and personal preferences. If you are
on Linux, chances you already know what your super key is.
⌥
The Option / Alt key.

alternate option of taking the stairs.

Escape. This is only useful if you make use of the Vim plugin for Sublime.
The arrow is trying to escape from the circle.
15.7 Creating Custom Keyboard Shortcuts
A few times this book has referenced functionality that doesn't have a keyboard
shortcut associated with it. Sometimes you may also wish to re-map specific
functionality to a new keyboard shortcut. Creating your own keyboard shortcuts in
Sublime Text is easy.
130 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDefault Shortcuts
Just like with your Sublime Text preferences, there is a file full of the default
keymaps that you are encouraged to view, but should never edit. This file is over-
written when Sublime Text is updated.
To view the default file, open it via Preferences → Key Bindings -
Default . Scan though this file quickly to get a feel for the syntax and then we
will break it down in the next section.
Your Custom Keymap File
Custom keymaps are operating system specific - this means that Windows, Linux
and OSX each will have their own keymap file called: Default
(Windows).sublime-keymap , Default (Linux).sublime-
keymap and Default (OSX).sublime-keymap . To create or open yours,
open Preferences → Key Bindings - Default and the editor will
open your OS specific file.
This file is also JSON formatted as one big array of keymaps. So, if you have an
empty keymap, you can start it like so:
[
// start here
]
Each keyboard shortcut is stored as an object {} and takes four properties.
131 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFor this example, I'm going to be creating a keyboard shortcut to open the Sublime
Text Preferences folder. We know we can press ⌘/Ctrl + , to open the settings
file, so I want to use ⌘/Ctrl + Shift + , to open the folder on my
computer.
keys
Keys is an array of keys that make up the shortcut. Most of the time you will have a
single value composed on two or more keys.
In this case, I want to use the combination of ⌘ Shift and , , so my object
looks like this so far:
{ "keys" : ["super+shift+,"] }
Note how there is a + in between each key. If I wanted to have a two-stage
keyboard shortcut, such as ⌘ + K , ⌘ + B to toggle the sidebar, we would have
multiple entries in the array:
{ "keys" : ["super+k","super+b"] }
command
Once we have which keys need to be pressed, we need to specify the command to
run.
There are hundreds of commands that could be run and while there is no official list
of commands from Sublime Text, the docs project has done a fantastic job at
collecting and documenting them as they find them.
132 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe other way to find out which command you want is to browse the Default file
for those that are already implemented.
The command we want is open_dir , which as you may guess will open up a
directory in Finder/Explorer. Our keyboard shortcut now looks like this:
{ "keys" : ["super+shift+,"], "command" : "open_dir" }
Many of these commands are for package developers, here are a handful of ones
you may find helpful:
move and move_to advance the caret by any number of words/characters/lines/
etc..
run_macro will run a specific macro, more on this in the Macros chapter.
expand_selection will expand your selected text to bol, hardbol, eol,
hardeol, bof, eof, brackets, line, tag, scope or indentation.
new_file will create a new file - I have remapped this to ⌘ + T as every
other program uses this convention to open a new tab.
new_window opens a new instance of Sublime Text - I have remapped this to ⌘
+ N just as many other programs do.
args
Arguments provide more information to the command. Our command right now
just runs "open_dir". Which one? We can use arguments to specify this.
133 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserEach command will have different argument names - it is best to look them up
either in the unofficial docs or in the Default file. In our case, we need to set the
dir property on the arg object. At this point, it's nice to format the object on
multiple lines:
{
"keys" : ["super+shift+,"],
"command" : "open_dir",
"args" : {
"dir" : "$packages"
}
}
Above we used a system variable - there are a number available to use in keyboard
shortcuts and they are the same ones available in build systems. For more on this
read the build systems chapter and check out the documentation for a list of all
variables.
context
The final property is context and it allows keyboard shortcuts to be bound only
in certain circumstance, or contexts.
For example, we may want to bind the enter key only when the autocomplete
dialog is open, otherwise enter should do as it was normally intended.
Or, maybe a keyboard shortcut should only be bound when we are editing a bit of
CSS, and not JavaScript:
Context has four property/values:
134 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe key is the context you are testing for, such as num_selections ,
setting.spell_check or selector (current scope). Check the docs for a
full list.
The operator can be equal/not_equal , regex_match/
not_regex_match or regex_contains/not_regex_contains .
The operand is what is being tested against, can be true , false , a
number or a regex .
match_all is by default set to false, but allows you to turn on matching for
every selection when using multiple carets / selections.
Example
Let's say I'm working with PHP and I need a quick way to open up my localhost
server to the current project. I can use the context selector to keybind ⌘ + K , ⌘
+ O to open the local server in my default browser, but only when editing PHP
files:
{
"keys" : ["super+k","super+o"],
"command" : "open_url",
"args" : {
"url" : "http://localhost/project-name"
},
"context" : [{
"key" : "selector",
"operator" : "regex_match",
"operand" : "source.php"
}]
}

Sublime Text Power User15.8 Dealing with Keyboard Shortcut Conflicts
Once you have enough packages, chances are that some keyboard shortcuts will
conflict each other.
If you find you are having trouble tracking down which commands conflict,
installing the package FindKeyConflicts will produce a list of conflicting key
shortcuts:
You can also search by command, so if there is a specific command you are having
trouble with, it will produce a list of packages and then their available commands:

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 16
Macros
Macros are a small, yet powerful, part of Sublime Text that allow you to record a
series of steps and then play them back. Many developers think macros are just for
large repetitive tasks, but the real power comes from shortening the number of
keystrokes it takes to do a simple task. Making 3-4 keystrokes into a single
keystroke can greatly speed up your development time. These are micro
improvements, but they really add up over the long run.
One example that I use very frequently is for when you're writing JavaScript
functions. Using Sublime, the function looks like this, with the | denoting the
cursor.
var someFn = function() {
|
}
Sometimes I need to add a semi-colon to the end of the function. To do that, I
would:
1. Arrow down
2. Type a semi colon
137 of 225
Sublime Text Power User3. Arrow back up
4. Tab inwards
5. Start writing my code
Since I only want a semicolon some of the time, it doesn't make sense to create a
snippet here, but rather record a macro that does these steps for me.
16.1 Recording a Macro
To record a macro, simply setup a piece of code that you would normally be
editing. In my case, it's the snippet of JavaScript above. Then follow these steps:
1. Go to Tools → Record Macro
2. The macro is now recording, so go ahead and go through the steps of the macro. For my macro, I
will follow steps 1-4 above.
3. Stop recording when finished via , Tools → Stop Recording Macro
4. Save the macro via Tools → Save Macro . This will go in your User directory and just like
snippets, I like to create my own folder for macros.
That's it, you should now see your macro available under Tools → Macros →
User which will execute when you click it.
16.2 Adding a Keyboard Shortcut
If you have to use the above menu technique to execute a macro, it doesn't really
save you any time. The smart thing to do would be to bind it to a keyboard shortcut.
To do this, open your keyboard bindings via Preferences → Key
Bindings — User .
Depending on if this is your first keyboard shortcut, this file may or may not have
text inside of it already. This file is an array of keyboard shortcut objects, so go
ahead and add a line like this:
[
{ "keys" : ["super+;"], "command": "run_macro", "args": {"file":
138 of 225
Sublime Text Power User"function-semicolon}"} }
]
The above set the keys super (⌘) and ; to run this macro. You can see we
are using the command run_macro which accepts an argument file of
whatever you named your macro file, less the .sublime-macro extension.
If you have multiple keyboard shortcuts in here it will look like below. Remember
to put a comma after each item except for the final one.
[
{ "keys" : ["super+;"], "command": "run_macro", "args": {"file":
"function-semicolon}"} },
{ "keys": ["super+shift+,"], "command": "open_dir", "args":
{"dir": "$packages"} }
]
16.3 Editing Macros
If the macro recording didn't turn out exactly as you wished, you can always edit
them by hand. If you open any .sublime-macro file you will see the array of
action objects. Using the Sublime Text commands reference you are able to build
out some pretty complex macros.

Running, Testing and Deploying with
Build Systems
Build systems allow you to run your command line tools right from Sublime Text -
these are commonly commands such as compass , make , rake or grunt ,
but can really be anything that is available from the command line.
It's important to note here that build systems aren't a replacement for tools like
Gulp, Grunt, Rake, Ant or Make, but rather a way to run these tools from the editor
and see the response without leaving the editor. Depending on the workflow, you
may find you do not wish to replace having a terminal window open with a
Sublime Text build system. If you heavily use the terminal to work with your apps,
you may wish to forgo build systems and use your terminal alongside Sublime Text.
17.1 Creating a Build File
Build tasks are housed in a .sublime-build file which is a JSON file that
holds a number of options for running it.
140 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserYour own build files can live anywhere in your User folder. I recommend
creating a build folder inside of the your User folder that will hold all of your
build tasks.
At its simplest, a build file takes the cmd argument. This is the command that will
be executed when the build is run.
Let's build something to run "ls -l" (listing the directory files)
{
"cmd" : "ls -l"
}
You can then select the build system from Tools → Build System and hit
⌘ + B to run it.
You may or may not see build results. If you don't, open the build results tab
( Tools → Build Results → Show Build Results ). If you'd rather
hide the results, set "show_panel_on_build": false in your
Preferences.sublime-settings file.
Selectors
Just as we can with snippets, we can limit the scope of a build system to a specific
language with the selector attribute.
Let's say we only want the above build to work in PHP files:
{
"cmd" : "ls -l",
"selector" : "source.php"
}
141 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserYou can also pass an array of multiple sources:
{
"cmd" : "ls -l",
"selector" : ["source.scss","source.sass"]
}
Then set the build system to Automatic under Tools → Build System
and this build system should be selected automatically.
Variables
When running commands, chances are you need some information about the
current file or folder to run that command. This is where variables come in.
Let's say I'm working on style.scss and I want to compile it to
style.css .
We can easily make a build system that looks like this:
{
"cmd": ["sass","style.scss", "style.css"],
"selector" : "source.scss",
}
Note how instead of specifying a single cmd string above, I've passed an array. It is
recommended that you use an array of commands rather than spaces in a string.
Now, make sure the build system is set, and run it with ⌘ + B .
The above is great, but there are a few questions to ask yourself here:
1. What if our file isn't called style.scss?
2. What if we want to rename the output file to something else? like output-style.css
3. What if we want to move the directory?
142 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWith variables, we can pass along information about the current file and directory.
For instance, the above build system is better written as:
{
"cmd": ["sass","${file_name}", "${file_base_name}.css"],
"selector" : "source.scss"
}
What about different folders? We can use the project folder variable:
{
"cmd": ["sass","${file_name}",
"${project_path}/css/${file_base_name}.css"],
"selector" : "source.scss"
}
For a list of all variables, check out the documentation
Capturing Errors
If you run the command and there is an error, you want to know where the error
occurred. Rather than spew everything into the console, build systems have two
settings - file_regex and line_regex which allow you to find the exact
file and line where the error occurred.
Path Issues
Sometimes you might run into issues where Sublime Text can't find the command
you are trying to run. This often happens when you are running multiple versions of
ruby, or the executable is located somewhere other than your $PATH variable.
143 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFor this we need to specifically tell Sublime where it is. For instance, I had trouble
running the sass gem because I use RVM for multiple versions of ruby. To fix, open
up a terminal window and type which sass to see where the gem is installed.
We can then use the path option in our build file like so:
{
"cmd": ["sass","style.scss", "style.css"],
"selector" : "source.scss",
"path" : "/Users/wesbos/.rvm/gems/ruby-2.1.1/bin/sass"
}
Cross Platform
You can even set different options based on your operating system. Handy if you
switch between Mac/Linux/PC often:
{
"selector" : "source.scss",
"osx" : {
"cmd" : ["rm", "$file_name"]
},
"windows" : {
"cmd" : ["rd", "$file_name"]
}
}
17.2 Build Resources
Build systems may seem simple, but there are many variables that go into creating a
build system depending on which language, OS or method you choose. Here are a
few fantastic resources and further reading on the subject:

Bookmarks
Bookmarks are a great way to reference points in your codebase, making them
easier to jump to. I find that I use bookmarks for temporary reference points inside
of a document, while I use the Goto Anything palette for all other jumping around.
With Bookmarks, you are bookmarking that line of code, not the line number.
Bookmarks stay with the line you initially intended, so adding or removing code
before the bookmark will not affect it. They do not, however, stay with you when
you copy/cut/paste lines of code. If you delete a line of code, the bookmark will be
assigned to the line of code below the deleted line.
Note: Bookmarks also remember the columns (or character) that you bookmarked it at, so it is
possible to have multiple bookmarks per line.
You can access the bookmark menu under Goto → Bookmarks but I suggest
getting comfortable with the keyboard shortcuts.
146 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSet / toggle a bookmark with ⌘ + F2 . If you are using an Apple keyboard, make
sure you are also pressing FN . You'll notice that a tiny little chevron shows up in
the gutter marking the bookmark.
Windows and Linux users should use Ctrl in the place of ⌘ .
You can cycle through your document's bookmarks with F2 , or reverse the cycle
Shift + F2 . Clear all bookmarks with ⌘ + Shift + F2 .
Sublime offers an option to select all bookmarked positions via the menu system. If
you would like to create a keyboard shortcut for this, use the command
select_all_bookmarks and reference the section on creating your own
keyboard shortcuts.

Working with Git
If you work on a team or collaborate on any sort of open source project, you
probably use git and GitHub for version control. While GitHub offers a GUI
application for working with git, many developers still prefer the speed and
simplicity of the command line. Using git inside of Sublime Text allows you to
have many of the command line benefits without ever having to leave the editor.
I have also found that the menu system and language used in Sublime Text Git is
really nice for beginners who aren't entirely sure what all the git commands are -
simply typing git into the commands palette will give you all available git
commands for that current file and repo. This is a great way for beginners to learn
and git comfortable with git.
148 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSublime doesn't have git integration out of the box so we need to install a package.
There are a number of packages for using git within Sublime Text and the one you
pick is really up to your own personal preference. I prefer to use one simply called
git (https://github.com/kemayo/sublime-text-2-git/) as it allows me to access every
single command from the Sublime command palette - this is very much integrated
with how you should be using Sublime Text. Later in this chapter we will review a
few more packages that you may find helpful when working with git.
19.1 Sublime + Git Tutorial
Gittin' Ready
This tutorial assumes you at least have an idea of what git is and why you would
use it for version control. If you are completely new to git, follow along, you will
learn how to go from a blank slate to adding files to github in this basic tutorial. If
you are already a git power user, you may want to just skim this tutorial to see how
everything lines up with your terminal/cmd line experience.
Before we go ahead, make sure you have git installed. If you have never setup git
on your computer before, GitHub has a great guide on how to do so.
So, to install Sublime Git, open up Package Control with ⌘ + Shift + P and
type install package.
Type git and hit enter to install. Wait a few seconds and you are good to go!
149 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserGittin' Goin'
First thing we need to do is initialize a blank git repository. Simply bring up the
command palette ( ⌘ + Shift + P ) and type git init . You will be
prompted to double check the directory path in the bottom of the editor - make sure
you are initializing the repo in the folder that you really want it in. We now have an
empty git repository on our local computer.
The next step is to link things up with our github account. If you use bitbucket,
gitlab or some other remote repo, simply sub this URL out for yours.
Now, this package provides commands for most common git use cases, but
sometimes you will need to run a more specific git command. One time this is true
is when you are adding a remote github repo to your local repo. For this, bring up
the command palette and type git custom . This will bring up an input in the
bottom of your editor.
150 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserGo grab your github url and type remote add origin <your github
repo url> into the command palette. Make sure to leave off the git part as
Sublime will run your command as git [whatever you type] .
Adds and Commits
At any time you can take a look at the status of your git repo by simply running the
git status command. Here is what mine looks like after initializing the repo
and creating 3 files in the directory:
The ?? denotes that those files are in the folder, but are untracked -- they haven't
been added to the repo yet. Add files to the repo by bringing up the command
palette and typing git add
151 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThis will bring up a second screen with the option to add tracked files, all files
including untracked, or a single file from the git repo. Since we haven't added
anything to the repo yet, let's go ahead and + All Files including
untracked files
Now when we do a quick git status we can see all three files changed from
?? to A -- this means they have been Added to the repo.
You are also able to quickly add a single file by bringing up the command palette and running git add
current file
Next we want to commit the files and then push them to our github repo. You
probably have the hang of this by now - open up the command palette and type git
commit. This will bring up a file called COMMIT_EDITMSG. Simply just type
your commit message at the top of the file and close it ( ⌘ + W ) - no need to save
this file.

Sublime Text Power UserSo, we have added our files to the repo and committed those changes - now it's time
to push them to the github repo. Open the command palette and type git push. All
of your currently committed files will be pushed to github and you should receive a
success message in the lower bottom pane of Sublime Text.
153 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserDiffing
One of my favorite parts about having git baked right into Sublime Text is the
ability to diff files right inside the text editor.
I'm going to make a few changes to my bookstyle.css file and then run Git
diff current file when I have it open. Git will compare the file against the
one we just added, committed and pushed.
154 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIf you have never seen a diff file before, the black (called headers) gives you a
summary of whats going on in this diff, the green are added lines of code, and the
red are deleted lines of code.
Gitting everything else
I could write an entire book on how to use git, so for the sake of keeping on track
I'm not going to go through every single git command available. Here are a few
common commands as well as a few handy Sublime Text nuggets.
Pulling - git pull pulls the latest changes from the repo. Pretty simple but
crucial when you work on open source or on a team.
155 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserBranching - Sublime Git offers a great menu of options for working with branches
- you can easily create, switch, pull, push, delete and merge branches without
having to remember all those CLI arguments.
Open modified files - Use this to quickly open all files that have been modified.
Great for reviewing your code before you add and commit to a repo.
Quick Commit - Busy person? Don't have time to add and commit your file? Add
and commit the current file in just one fell swoop by choosing git quick commit
from the command palette.
19.2 Additional Git Packages
Sidebar Git
There is an alternative package called SideBar Git (https://github.com/
SublimeText/SideBarGit) which will allow you to manage your files in the sidebar
by right-clicking files/folders and triggering commands that way. I feel that the
command palette in the above plugin is far superior than clicking around - but to
each his/her own. This package also does not currently support git tagging.
156 of 225
Sublime Text Power User19.3 GitGutter
When working on project that involves Git, it's helpful to know what lines have be
added, edited or deleted.
Git gutter is a simple yet powerful package that will show you just that, with icons
in the gutter.
If your gutter icons are just white, you need to make sure you are using a theme that
supports GitGutter. The package's readme has a list of supported colour schemes as
well as instructions on how to make your theme ready.
Sublimerge
This plugin lets you diff and merge files from a git or svn repo right inside the
Sublime Text GUI. I prefer to use something a little more graphical to do merges,
but it looks to work great!
Comparing and Merging Two Files
At its simplest, Sublimerge is great at comparing two files in your project - no
version control involved.
To use, simply select two files from the sidebar, right-click and select Compare
selected files .
This will open the files side by side and highlight the differences.
157 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFrom there, we can step through each change and either move it to the left, right or
ignore it.
To start the merge process, right-click anywhere in the editor and select Go to
Next Change or type control + Option + = and then use
Ctrl + Option + , /+ Ctrl + Option + . to merge to the right and left
accordingly.
158 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserComparing Git Revisions
Sublimerge is aware of your git repo and is able to compare against different
commits.
To use this, open your git repo in Sublime and select a file from the sidebar with a
right-click and you will see three options:
1. Compare To Revision — This will compare the current file to any previous git commit. When you
select this, you will be asked to choose a previous commit to compare it to.
2. Compare Revision to Revision — Similar to above, but rather than comparing the current file to a
commit, you will be asked to select two commits to compare against each other.
3. Show Changes Introduced in Revision - select any revision and view which new changes were
introduced with that commit.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 20
Mastering Emmet
Emmet is a package for Sublime Text that helps with writing of CSS and HTML.
To say that it speeds you up is an understatement, you would be silly to code
HTML or CSS without this package installed.
If you are already familiar with Zen Coding don't skip this chapter just yet, Emmet
is its successor that does so much more than the original Zen Coding. While you
can get the Emmet package for pretty much any editor, we are going to cover it
extensively as is so well aligned with the philosophy of Sublime Text.
20.1 Emmet and HTML
Emmet is most famous for it's HTML shortcuts. If you write Jade, Slim or HAML,
everything here translates 100% with the latest version of Emmet.
With almost everything in Sublime Text, you type your shortcut and then hit the
tab key.
161 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserElements
Start off simple, type the element name you want and hit tab. Notice how Emmet
puts your cursor right inside the tags? Handy!
p + tab → <p>|</p>
span + tab → <span>|</span>
img + tab → <img src="|" alt="">
Classes and IDs
Then we can step it up and add classes.
span.warning → <span class="warning"></span>
If you leave out the element before the class, it assumes a div:
.wrapper → <div class="wrapper"></div>
Notice how these are just CSS selectors + tab?
ul.nav → <ul class="nav"></ul>
Works with IDs too:
h2#post23 → <h2 id="post23"></h2>
You can also do both at the same time:
.post#post23 → <div class="post" id="post23"></div>
162 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserAttributes
Just like CSS, you can also use square brackets to denote element attributes
input[placeholder="username"] → <input type="text"
placeholder="username">
There is no limit to how many attributes you can set at once:
img[src="dog.jpg"][alt="Cute puppy"] → <img
src="dog.jpg" alt="Cute puppy">
You can even mix and match with classes/IDs:
label.name[for="first"] → <label for="first"
class="name"></label>
Text
New to Emmet is the ability to insert text inside the elements:
p{hello world} → <p>hello world</p>
As always this can be used with any of the existing things we have learned:
span.warning{Watch out man!} → <span
class="warning">Watch out man!</span>
Multiple Elements and $ placeholder
We have all needed to quickly generate a bunch of elements before. Rather than
copy/paste, we can use the asterisk to multiply the number of elements:
163 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userli*3 →
<li></li>
<li></li>
<li></li>
As always, everything we learned before can be applied. Just make sure to put the
*n at the end of your recipe:
label.display{Yeah!}*2 → <label for=""
class="display">Yeah!</label><label for=""
class="display">Yeah!</label>
A common use case for this is when your create a number of elements, each with a
class of box , but they also need a unique class such as box1 , box2 , etc..
This is where the amazing $ increment placeholder comes in. Just use $ where
you want 1/2/3 to be, and Emmet will replace it for you.
.box.box$*5 →
<div
<div
<div
<div
<div
class="box
class="box
class="box
class="box
class="box
box1"></div>
box2"></div>
box3"></div>
box4"></div>
box5"></div>
Awesome! The dollar sign works anywhere in an Emmet string.
li{Item $}*3 →
164 of 225
Sublime Text Power User<li>Item 1</li>
<li>Item 2</li>
<li>Item 3</li>
If you uses more than one $ , a leading zero will be placed for numbers under that
many digits.
img[src="dog$.jpg"]*10 →
<img
<img
...
<img
<img
src="dog01.jpg" alt="">
src="dog02.jpg" alt="">
src="dog09.jpg" alt="">
src="dog10.jpg" alt="">
You can start the numbering at certain number:
li.item$@5*3 →
<li class="item5"></li>
<li class="item6"></li>
<li class="item7"></li>
And even count backwards!
p.countdown$@-*10 →
<p class="countdown10"></p>
<p class="countdown9"></p>
...
<p class="countdown2"></p>
<p class="countdown1"></p>
Nesting Elements
Finally, one of the most powerful features in Emmet is to nest elements.
165 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWe can use the > to specify children:
div.wrapper>p.warning{Watch Out} →
<div class="wrapper">
<p class="warning">Watch Out</p>
</div>
And yes it works with everything else!
ul>li.book${Book $}*5 →
<ul>
<li
<li
<li
<li
<li
</ul>
class="book1">Book
class="book2">Book
class="book3">Book
class="book4">Book
class="book5">Book
1</li>
2</li>
3</li>
4</li>
5</li>
We can do siblings with the +
header+section.post+footer.bottom →
<header></header>
<section class="post"></section>
<footer class="bottom"></footer>
Emmet Filters
A lesser-known part of Emmet is the ability to pipe any Emmet selector into a filter.
166 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserClosing Element Comments
For example, many developers like to add comments to the end of their elements so
they know when they start and end. For this we simply append |c to the end of
the selector like so:
.wrapper>.inner|c
And that gives us:
<div class="wrapper">
<div class="inner"></div>
<!-- /.inner -->
</div>
<!-- /.wrapper -->
Escaping HTML
Pipe to e to have escaped HTML returned:
span.hello|e → &lt;span class="hello"&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
Pipe to HAML or Jade
When you are in a HAML or Jade file, this is the default functionality, however if
you wish to get HAML or Jade in another HTML file - pipe in |haml or |jade
ul.drinks>li{Drink $}*3|jade →
ul.drinks
li Drink 1
li Drink 2
li Drink 3
167 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserExpand in a single Line
Emmet does a great job of putting block elements on their own line and inline ones
beside each other. If, for whatever reason, you wish to put everything on a single
line, pipe |s .
.wrapper>p.warning|S → <div class="wrapper"><p
class="warning"></p></div>
Even More
There are handful more HTML helpers including grouping, climbing, inputs and
document setup. I recommended you check the Emmet cheat sheet
http://docs.Emmet.io/cheat-sheet/
20.2 Emmet and CSS
The other major half of Emmet is useful when writing CSS (or Sass, LESS or
Stylus). Many think that Emmet is just a huge snippets library, when in reality it is
much more than that. The power of Emmet with CSS comes from the fuzzy
searching, which means that we can just type a few characters of what we want,
and Emmet will make a best guess for what we wanted.
For example, if we want to type overflow:hidden; , just type oh , o-h ,
ovhi , ovh or any number of combinations + tab and it will be replace with
overflow:hidden; .
This is huge because we no longer have to memorize or guess what the snippet was,
we can just type as much as we think will get us there and 95% of the time, it works
out!
168 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserMy preferred way of writing Emmet snippets is just to type the first 1-3 letters of
both the property and value.
posrel → position: relative;
posab → position: absolute;
fl → float:
fll → float: left;
fr → float: right;
db → display: block;
dib → display: inline-block;
tdn → text-decoration: none;
brad → border-radius:
c → color: #
w → width:
p → padding:
You can also put a dash - in between the property/value. This is helpful when
things aren't going the way you want.
169 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserFor example if you want position:absolute; , you might try pa .
However, that completes to padding: . Putting a dash between each letter will
fix this: p-a
Emmet also allows the use of a colon : in place of the above mentioned dash.
However, it doesn't play nice with Sublime Text because sublime text auto
completes the semicolon ; when you type a colon in CSS. So, best to just avoid
using the colon and stick with dashes or nothing at all.
Numbers and Units
So, Emmet works great for property/value key pairs that are words, but what about
number units?
We already know that w and h give us width: and height: , so let's step it
up a notch.
Adding a value after any Emmet snippet will set it in pixels:
w100 → width: 100px;
h200 → height: 200px;
p10 → padding: 10px;
mr3 → margin-right: 3px;
adding a p or % after the value will turn them to percentages:
w100p → width: 100%;
170 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userh200p → height: 200%;
p10p → padding: 10%;
mr3p → margin-right: 3%;
Similiarily e will set ems and r will set rems:
w100e → width: 100em;
h200r → height: 200rem;
p10e → padding: 10em;
mr3r → margin-right: 3rem;
We can set multiple sides at once with dashes:
p10-20-5-50 → padding: 10px 20px 5px 50px;
And use i for inherit and a for auto.
m0-a-i-a → margin: 0 auto inherit auto;
It knows about borders too!
b1-s-#000 → bottom: 1px solid #000;
bbw2r → border-bottom-width: 2rem;
171 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserColors
Colors in Emmet are pretty standard:
c → color:#000; c:r → color:rgb(0, 0, 0); c:ra →
color:rgba(0, 0, 0, .5);
As of Emmet 1.1, you can also covert hexcodes to RGBA values.
c#badda55.3 → color: rgba(186, 221, 165, 0.3);
bg#1d1.45 → background: rgba(17, 221, 17, 0.45);
bdc#fff.5 → border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.5);
More CSS
There are almost a thousand possible snippets you could expand to with Emmet,
most of which you can figure out by just typing the first few letters.
For more, make sure to visit the cheat sheet at http://docs.Emmet.io/cheat-sheet/
20.3 Other Emmet Hot Tips
The third part of Emmet is a handful of workflow/utility functions that it builds into
Sublime Text.
Wrap with Emmet Snippet
While Sublime Text already has a wrap selection with tag, it's not nearly as nice or
flexible as Emmet. Sublime Text only allows to you specify the tag name - no
classes/ids/attributes/nesting or any of the great things Emmet has to offer.
172 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTo use this, you simply need to be in any HTML/Slim/Jade/HAML document,
select the text you want and hit Ctrl + w or select Emmet: Wrap With
Abbreviation from the command palette.
This will open an input box at the bottom of the editor, where you can type any
previously learned Emmet snippet. The default is a div, but you can put anything in
here.

Sublime Text Power User174 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWhen finished, hit <enter> to return to editing your code!
Encoding / Decoding Data URI
Data URIs are a way to convert binary files (usually PNGs and JPGs) into a single
string of text. This allows you to include images into your HTML or CSS without
having any external files.
We can use them in both HTML and CSS.
<img src="dot.png">
becomes
<img src="data:image/
png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAUAAAAFCAYAAACNbyblAAAAHElEQVQI12P4//8w38G
and in CSS
li {
background-image:url('check.png');
}
becomes
li {
background-image:url('data:image/
png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAABAAAAAQAQMAAAAlPW0iAAAABlBMVEUAAAD///+l2Z/
dAAAAM0lEQVR4nGP4/5/h/1+G/58ZDrAz3D/McH8yw83NDDeNGe4Ug9C9zwz3gVLMDA/
A6P9/AFGGFyjOXZtQAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC');
}
I won't get into all about DataURIs right now, but for more info, read up on the
Data URI Wikipedia Article.
175 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe cool thing about Emmet is that rather than using some generator to convert
them, you can do it right from the editor itself! When in either CSS or HTML, put
your cursor anywhere in the file path and hit Ctrl + Shift + D or select
Emmet: Encode/Decode Image to data:URI from the command
palette.
Data URIs are usually huge, so if you are using them, I recommend turning line
wrapping off.
Increment/Decrement
When writing CSS, you often need to bump values up or down by 0.1/1/10. Rather
than backspacing your current value and re-writing the new one, you can use
keyboard shortcuts to increment/decrement them!
For example, given this CSS. I want to increment each one 3px, 0.3rem and 30%
accordingly. You are probably used to this functionality from Chrome/Firefox
developer tools.
.wrapper {
padding:10px;
font-size:1.3rem;
176 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userwidth:50%;
}
Simply put your cursor anywhere within the number and use:
Ctrl + ↕ → up/down by 1
Alt + ↕ → up/down by 0.1
Alt + ⌘ + ↕ → up/down by 10
Lorem Ipsum
When building a proof of concept app/web page, placeholder text is something that
can really slow you down. Thankfully Emmet can solve all of this for you.
To get placeholder text, simply type lorem and hit tab.
lorem → Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipisicing elit. Repellendus voluptatibus voluptas,
ipsa quod officia quaerat at possimus veritatis eveniet
nemo dolores fuga quibusdam explicabo. Hic quae facere
eius aut consectetur.
Only want a bit, or a lot? Append the number of words you wish to have at the end
of the word lorem:
lorem5 → Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.
You can also use this with Emmet snippets:
177 of 225
Sublime Text Power Userp>lorem → <p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur
adipisicing elit. Expedita inventore, error odit beatae,
eveniet ratione modi ipsum nulla ex obcaecati cupiditate
quam quae nam consequuntur tenetur fugiat harum, dolore
repudiandae.</p>
even multiples!
ul>li*3>lorem4 →
<ul>
<li>Lorem ipsum dolor sit.</li>
<li>Totam tenetur dicta incidunt.</li>
<li>Blanditiis illo laborum reiciendis.</li>
</ul>
Matching Pair
Long nested HTML? Sometimes it is hard to find which closing element belongs to
what. With matching pair you can jump to the associated open/close tag.
Open this via the command palette or use the Ctrl + Shift + T shortcut.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 21
Workflow & Code Quality
As a developer, how you work should be very important to you. By buying this
book, you are obviously very aware that your workflow can really impact the speed
at which you work as well as the quality of code you end up producing.
This section will cover various tools that you can use to both speed up how you
work as well as maintain and improve code quality.
21.1 Live Reload
Live Reload is an package that communicates with your browser to reload your
page whenever a change to your website is make. It is one of my absolutely favorite
tools in my web development workflow because it speeds things up so quickly.
You may not realize it, but moving away from your editor to refresh your browser
can take a few seconds, and if you are doing this a few times a minute (and even
more if you are working on tweaking your CSS) it can quickly add up. Saving a
few seconds, 3 times a minute can add up to well over 3 hours over the course of
your week!
179 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserInstalling
There are two steps to install Live Reload. The first is the Sublime Text package.
As we always do, go ahead and search for Live Reload in Package Control. Go
ahead and install it. When done, Sublime will need a full restart.
The second step is to get Sublime working with your web browser. Live Reload
uses web sockets to communicate with the browser when changes are made. If you
are using Chrome, Safari or Firefox on the desktop, there are great packages that
get everything running for you. Visit Live Reload website for links on each of
those.
If you are using the chrome plugin, make sure you check the box that says "Allow
access to file URLs" otherwise you will be limited to local servers.
Live Reload on mobile devices
If you are running on another browser that doesn't support extensions, like a mobile
browser, you can still use Live Reload by placing the following JavaScript snippet
into your web page or application:
180 of 225
Sublime Text Power User<script src="http://localhost:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
To break that down, localhost is the local name for the server running on your
computer and 35729 is the port which Live Reload runs on.
If you are running Live Reload on your computer but testing on another computer
or mobile device, you will want to switch localhost with the IP address or
local name of your computer. My computer is named w , has the IP address of
192.168.124.112 and I have a local domain of test.com setup on my
router (more info here) so any of the following will work as long as the devices are
on the same WIFI network.
<script src="http://w:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
<script src="http://192.168.124.112:35729/
livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
<script src="http://test.com:35729/livereload.js?snipver=1"></script>
21.2 Sublime Server
If you are a front end developer working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, chances
are that you working locally. Being able to spin up a local server quickly is
extremely helpful. There are no databases or programming languages involved
here, simply just serving up static files as you would with Python's
simpleHTTPserver or a LAMP install.
Sublime Server is a package for Sublime Text that allows you start a localhost
server in a matter of seconds. The really nice thing about this package is that it will
serve up any directory or project you currently have open in sublime text, you aren't
limited to a single parent directory — go ahead and add directories from anywhere
on your computer.
181 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIt also replaces the native "Open in browser" functionality by opening that file on
your locahost instead of the file system. This is key for when you are working with
JavaScript AJAX requests that must be running in a server environment.
Installation and Usage
To install, open your command palette and type "install package". When the list
comes up, search for "Sublime Server" and hit enter. That is it, as simple as it gets.
Usage of Sublime Server is also pretty straight forward. Make sure you have a
project or a few folders open in Sublime and then go ahead and type "start" into
your command palette giving you the option to start the server.
Once you have done that, nothing will happen but the server will be running in the
background. By default the server runs on port 8080 which means that you can
view all your files by going to http://localhost:8080/ in the browser.
If you are already running something on port 8080 you can change this value and a
few others in the settings available at Tools → SublimeServer →
Settings...
You also have the option of viewing your files straight from Sublime Text. To do
this, right-click any file and select "View This File in the Browser". This will open
your file in your preferred browser under the localhost server.
182 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIf you add folders to Sublime that you want served up, simply use the Restart
SublimeServer command. Once you are finished developing you can use the Stop
SublimeServer command. It's recommended that you turn this off when on a
public network because anyone with your IP address would be able to view your
served up files.
21.3 Live Linting with SublimeLinter
In the programming world, each language has a tool called a linter that analyses
your code, checking and flagging for potential errors, bad habits and consistency
mistakes.
A linting tool goes a long way in improving your coding style and a live linter is
like a slap on the hand every time you do something as little as forget a semi-colon
or use a restricted name for a method. A linting tool also lets you know when your
code is broken, saving you a trip to the browser/compiler/server to realize that you
made a mistake.
183 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe holy grail of linting packages for Sublime is called SublimeLinter. It provides
linting for 16 languages and growing, this includes C/C++, CoffeeScript, CSS, Git
Commit Messages, Haml, HTML, Java, JavaScript, Lua, Objective-J, Perl, PHP,
Puppet, Python, Ruby and XML.
Refer to the package installation section of this book to install SublimeLinter. For a
few languages, the package kicks off the linting task to the system installation of
that language so if you are trying to lint PHP, make sure you have php installed. If
you are trying to lint ruby, make sure you have ruby installed. You get the point :)
Additionally, if you are a JavaScript developer, you must also have Node.js
installed. If you do not, head on over to http://nodejs.org/ and download one of the
easy installers for mac, windows or linux.
Linting your code
Since most developers reading this book will touch on JavaScript at some point, I
will be using JavaScript as an example here, but the process for every langauge is
the same.
By default the linting kicks in after 2 seconds or on file save. If there is an error in
your code, you will automatically see lines surround the code that is affected.
Which color something shows up as depends on if your theme supports Sublime
Linter or not. My Cobalt2 theme supports it so you will see warnings in orange and
illegal statements in red. Other themes will simply show you white lines around the
affected code.
184 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserJavaScript Linting Example
Here is an example of some JavaScript I wrote. At first glance, it may seem
harmless and will even run just fine. The linter is throwing flags on two items as
they may cause trouble down the road in our development.
CSS Linting Example
Here is another example in CSS. While most haven't heard of linting CSS, its great
practice to get out of bad habits. In this example, I have "using ids" set to warning
so I'm seeing orange while using the color 'weswhite' is illegal red because that is
not a real color.
185 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserLinting Settings
Every developer has their own style and they might not agree with all the rules that
are set by default in the linter settings. That is totally okay and is why linters have
the ability to turn on and off different rules. A big part of the linter is to make sure
that you are consistent with your coding style.
All of your user specific linting settings should go to into a file located at
Packages/User/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings . If you do not
have that file, go ahead and create it manually or by using the menu
Preferences → Package Settings → SublimeLinter →
Settings - User .
A reference of all the available settings can be found at Packages/
SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter.sublime-settings . Even more
options can be found by referencing that language's linting documentation. Make
sure to not edit these in place as they will be overwritten next time the package is
setup. Instead copy the settings out and change them in your file inside the User
directory.
For example, if I was a total boss that knew exactly how JavaScript automatic
semicolon insertion (ASI) worked, I could opt to turn off that rule in my own
settings document like so:
186 of 225
Sublime Text Power User21.4 Working with FTP / SFTP
Like it or not, FTP is still a part of many developer's workflow. While I encourage
you to embrace git version control and deployment systems such as grunt, Gulp,
rsync, ssh, codeship or capistrano, there are still times when SFTP/FTP is needed.
For this, there are two good solutions which we will now dive into.
SFTP Package
The SFTP package by Will Bond is a fantastic cross-platform, stand-alone solution.
The trial is fully featured and untimed, continued use runs $16 for the package and
it is worth every penny. Will Bond is the developer behind Sublime Package
Control so I feel $16 is a drop in the bucket considering all he has done for the
Sublime Text community.
The SFTP supports FTP, FTPS and SFTP servers as well as SSH key
authentication. As an added bonus, the package can detect changes via Git,
Mercurial and SVN. As with all things in Sublime Text, if you are used to a nice
graphical interface, this will take a little getting used to.
187 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTo get started, install the package via Package Control, just as you would any other
package. We then have two options: map a local directory to a remote server or to
simply just tap into a remote server.
Remote only server
Again, I do not recommend simply FTPing into a remote server as that is a poor
workflow, but there are situations where this will happen.
Open up a blank window of Sublime and Choose File → SFTP/FTP →
Setup Server . This opens up the screen for configuring your server which in
true Sublime Text style, is just a JSON file. Uncomment the options that you
require and change the others - this is the same as any other FTP program.
This package comes with good defaults so if you are using a common hosting
provider, chances are you can leave most of them as-is only changing type ,
host , user and either password or ssh_key_file .
Because these files are stored as plain text on your hard drive, I recommend using
SSH keys rather than a text password. That way if you get hacked or accidentally
share one of these config files, there is no harm done.
188 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWhen you are finished, ⌘S to save it in Packages/user/sftp_servers .
The file name will be used as the server name, so save it as something descriptive
— spaces are allowed and you should not include any extension.
Once saved, pop open your command palette and type to find SFTP Browse
Server . This will list all your available servers, just one if this is your first.
Select the one you wish to connect to.
189 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserIf all your credentials are correct, you will see a listing of all your server's files.
Everything is done through the drop-down palette, so resist the urge to use your
mouse, use your arrow keys to traverse through your folders. At the top of each
folder/file, you have a list of the usual FTP options such as creating, deleting and
CHMODing the permissions.
190 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserWorking with the drop down palette can be slow and a little disruptive of your
workflow. At the time of writing there are a few solutions on Will Bond's site that
are in development to implement a sidebar with the remote files.
191 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserMapping local to remote
The other (and safer) way to manage your FTP is to link a local directory to a
remote one on your server. This way you make edits to your local copy and then
sync your changes with the server. To set this up, open a project's folder in Sublime,
right-click the folder name and choose SFTP/FTP → Map to Remote . This
opens up a JSON file similar to the one we filled out in the last section but with a
few new options.
There are many options you can put in this file and I won't go into all of them here
but one really great option is to set the upload_on_save to true which will
automatically upload the file every time you save it. For a complete reference for
all the options visit the SFTP Package Website.
Save the above file in the directory that you would like to map to the remote server,
do not put in your users folder. Again, pay attention to whether or not you want to
include this file in your version control as it may contain sensitive information.
192 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSFTP → Filezilla
If you were a hardcore FileZilla user before Sublime Text you may have years and
years worth of FTP entries in FileZilla. Thankfully there is a nice little package
called SublimeZilla which allows you to import all your old favorites into Sublime
SFTP.
Transmit Doc Send
If you are coming from a text editor like Coda or used to using a visual interface for
managing your websites, you may be used to saving a local copy of your file and
then uploading it remotely with a key press. While the previously mentioned SFTP
package does this, there is another useful package for users of Panic's Transmit.
To use this package, go ahead an install it from github or from Package Control.
Once you have your local directory and remote FTP setup with Transmit, you can
simply use the Ctrl + u keyboard shortcut to trigger a "dock send". Transmit
will then figure out where the local file is, and which remote file it needs to replace.
Voilà, the file has been uploaded.
193 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserAdditionally, Ctrl + Shift + u will upload the file to the currently active
transmit connection.
21.5 Tricky trick: Renaming and moving files
You may have already caught on that a huge part of this book is doing things
without touching your mouse. The more you can do with your keyboard, the faster
you will be. One part of Sublime that I was using my mouse for was renaming files.
When this happens I would either right-click the file in my sidebar and rename it,
or do the same in my computer's file browser.
Just like almost everything in Sublime, you can do this via the command palette.
Just open it up and type rename. A text input will appear at the bottom of the screen
for you to rename the file.
So what? Well, the real trick here is something you can't otherwise do in Sublime
Text, and that is move files from one folder to another — there is no dragging and
dropping in the sidebar.
To move a file from one directory to another, simply append a directory structure
before the file name. Here are a few examples with a file called style.css.
To move the file into a sub-directory called css:
rename style.css to ./css/style.css
To move the file back to where it was:
rename style.css to ../style.css
194 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserTo create a directory called base inside of our css folder and then move
the file into that directory:
rename style.css to ./css/base/style.css
To get back up to our original spot, 2 directories up:
rename style.css to ../../style.css
Note I've prepended everything with their . or .. . In a file systems, these mean
current directory and parent directory.
21.6 Bower Integration
If you haven't heard of it, Bower is a front-end package manager much like NPM is
for Node, gem is for Ruby or PIP for Python. Rather than scouring the net and
downloading .js files, you can install them right from your editor.
While it might not make sense to use NPM, gem or pip from your editor because
you are in the terminal anyways, many front end developers can benefit from using
Bower right from Sublime Text.
First, make sure that you have Node installed, and then run npm install
bower -g from your terminal.
Next, install the bower package for Sublime Text.

Sublime Text Power UserBower Caveats
This plugin, developed by Ben Schwarz, is meant to be extremely simple. There are
a few things that you aren't able to do via the plugin. If you wish to save your
dependences into a bower.json file or run a bower update, you will still have to do
that from the command line.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 22
Vim Mode
It's almost sacrilegious to mention Vim in a book about Sublime Text. Vim users
love Vim and even mentioning Sublime Text around a Vim user can land you in a
heated discussion. If you are passionate about any editor, you are in fantastic shape.
I'm not here to debate which editor is better, but rather show you how you can
harness the power of Vim right inside of Sublime Text. If you want to replicate
100% of Vim inside Sublime Text, you should probably just use Vim, however
there are many parts of Vim which are replicated in Sublime Text which are very
welcome.
For those not familiar with Vim, a quick overview: it's an editor that has been
around for 20+ years. In fact, you probably already have Vim installed, just open up
your terminal and type vim . Vim a an extremely powerful tool that has a really
stripped down interface. It's like Sublime Text in that you are able to move around
quickly without the mouse and speed up your development with hundreds of
possible packages.
198 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserA huge part of the power of Vim comes from its non-standard way of interfacing
with the text in the editor. Instead of using your mouse, you use a series of
commands to move, select, cut, paste, delete, etc. Instead of being able to click
around your file and type, select and move text at once, Vim introduces the concept
of modes in which you can do different things in each mode.
22.1 Making Sublime Text act like Vim
Since this isn't a book about Vim, I'm not going go in depth about how to use Vim,
but rather how to get Sublime Text to behave like Vim.
22.2 Sublime Text 2
By default, Sublime Text 2 ships with a package called "Vintage" that provides the
Vim functionality. The package is developed openly on GitHub and while fairly
feature complete, it hasn't been updated in over a year. If you are using Sublime
Text 2, this is the package you need to be using.
To get started, we simply need to enable it. Open your User Preferences with ⌘ +
, and do a search for a setting called ignored_packages . You may have this
setting already if you have used Package Control to ignore a package, if you have
never ignored a package before, you will not see this setting. Since it's ignored by
default, we simply need to overwrite the default setting by omitting it. Your setting
should now look like this:
"ignored_packages": []
The above is just an empty array which overwrites the default of
"ignored_packages": ["Vintage"] . If you have other ignored
packages, your setting may look like this:
199 of 225
Sublime Text Power User"ignored_packages":
[
"SubliminalCollaborator",
"MarkdownEditing",
"Nettuts+ Fetch",
"Goto-CSS-Declaration"
]
You can also turn on Vintage mode at a language level by adding
"ignored_packages": [] to your language specific settings file—more on
this in the settings section.
22.3 Sublime Text 3
If you have upgraded to Sublime Text 3, using the Vintage package isn't the best
option for you. While you can get it working after sifting through the forums for
troubleshooting tips, there is a much better option called Vintageous .
Vintageous is a complete rewrite of the Vintage package made specifically for
Sublime Text 3. To install, simply find it via Package Control and hit enter. Like all
Sublime packages, the source is also available on GitHub.
22.4 Using Vintage Mode
Whether you are using ST2 Vintage or Sublime Text 3 Vintageous, the commands
are basically the same.
•
•
•
•
Press esc to enter normal/command mode.
Press i to enter insert mode
Press v to enter visual mode
Most other motions from vim have had their keys mapped
You are also able to use the following Vim CTRL keys:
• Ctrl+[ : Escape
200 of 225
Sublime Text Power User•
•
•
•
•
Ctrl+R
Ctrl+Y
Ctrl+E
Ctrl+F
Ctrl+B
: Redo
: Scroll down one line
: Scroll up one line
: Page Down
: Page Up
To enable these control keys, use the following settings in your User settings file.
"vintage_ctrl_keys": true // ST2
"vintageous_use_ctrl_keys": true // ST3
OSX Gotcha
If you are using OSX, Apple has implemented a press-and-hold to show character
variations. This isn't ideal because often you will want to hold down the hjkl
keys to move around your document. To disable this, open your computers terminal
(Found in Utilities) and paste the following. A restart may be required.
defaults write com.sublimetext.2 ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
and for Sublime Text 3:
defaults write com.sublimetext ApplePressAndHoldEnabled -bool false
22.5 What's not included
Sounds too good to be true, right? Well, maybe. The Sublime implementation of
Vim is done entirely with key bindings, which means that everything was already
possible with Sublime Text, but it has just been translated for those used to the Vim
keys.
201 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserMost importantly, Macros and commands haven't been ported as they are so tightly
tied with Vim. Not to fear, Sublime has these things implemented as well, you will
just need to learn or remap the keyboard shortcuts.

Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 23
Language Specific Tweaks
So far, this book has been pretty agnostic towards which languages you work with -
everything said so far is beneficial whether you are a frontend JS/CSS dev or a
hardcore Python fanatic. Sublime has done a pretty good job shipping with defaults
for most languages but they aren't perfect. As languages progress we are introduced
to new syntaxes, design patterns and in the case of JavaScript and CSS, new
languages!
If you work in any of the following languages, it will be helpful to take a look at
what you can to do make your environment just that much better.
23.1 CSS
CSS3 has been around for some time now, but the syntax highlighting built into
Sublime Text is still based on an old TextMate plugin.
Update your syntax highlighting by installing the CSS3 Syntax package.
203 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce done, you can set all your .css files to be highlighted using this new syntax
file rather than the old one. Open any .css file and go to view → syntax →
Open all with the current extension as... → css3
23.2 LESS, Sass and Stylus
Chances are you are using some sort of CSS pre-processor to write your CSS.
There are a number of tools that can make writing LESS,Sass,SCSS and Stylus
even more fun.
204 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSyntax Highlighting
The first is to get a proper syntax highlighter. Editing your files in CSS mode will
work somewhat, but to take advantage of all the syntax highlighting features you
will need to install the following for each language. All of these are available on
github or via package control.
LESS: LESS-Sublime Sass: Syntax-highlighting-for-Sass — also includes support
for ST3 GOTO anything. Stylus: Stylus Syntax Highlighting
Helpful Tools
Variables are a huge part of CSS Preprocessors and being able to access them via a
handy menu can really speed up your development time. The plugin sublime-list-
stylesheet-vars does this for all three languages and is a recommended installation
when working with one of these CSS preprocessors.
23.3 Coffeescript
Writing CoffeeScript in Sublime is a hoot with the CoffeeScript Sublime Plugin.
This package provides a ton of functionality surrounding the language including
syntax highlighting, snippets and building CoffeeScript.
You may be interested more in CoffeeScript compiling (see the build section) or
CoffeeScript linting (see code quality section).
23.4 Templating: HAML, Slim, EJS, Jade
Just as with CSS preprocessors, the web development world is filled with
templating languages.
HAML: Comes default with Sublime Text's Ruby package
205 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSlim: A collection of snippets and a syntax highlighter via slim-template
EJS: EJS syntax highlighting via EJS.tmLanguage
When working with these templating languages, you may find yourself with HTML
that you need to turn into HAML or Jade. For times like these, utilize the html-to-
jade and html-do-haml packages.
23.5 JavaScript
I am primarily a JavaScript developer, so fine tuning my environment has been a
ongoing pursuit. I've already talked about the live linting tools in this book but
there are a few other things we can do to make developing JavaScript in Sublime a
pleasure.
First off, the JavaScript syntax highlighter that comes with Sublime does a very
poor job at properly highlighting you code. It also isn't updated for all the new
goodies we are seeing in ES6 and ES7.
To remedy this, I recommend that you install the Babel syntax highlighter for
Sublime Text which is available in package control under Babel. This colour
scheme provides fantastic highlighting for everything in ES6, many of the new ES7
features as well as highlighting and some snippets for any React developers writing
JSX.
I also recommend installing the JavaScript snippets pack by JP Richardson. It is
available on GitHub and package control.
Make sure you also read the section on JSHint or ESLint below.
206 of 225
Sublime Text Power User23.6 jQuery
Code faster with the jQuery snippets pack
23.7 Node.js
The Sublime Text Node.js package provides a set of snippets, code completion of
the Node API, as well as a handful of useful commands for running Node from
Sublime Text.
23.8 PHP
• PhpCS This plugin adds PHP CodeSniffer, PHP Coding Standards Fixer, the PHP Linter, PHP Mess
Detector, Scheck support to Sublime Text.
• PhpDoc CodeDoc is a Sublime Text 2/3 plugin to speedup writing documenting comments.
• PhpBeautifier
• Laravel 5 Snippets
23.9 Wordpress
Sublime Text WordPress Package provides autocompletes and snippets for all of
the WordPress functions, hooks, constants and classes.
23.10 Python
• Python Auto-Complete auto-completes built-in functions of the python language.
23.11 Ruby
RuboCop is a static code analyzer that help your keep your coding style up to the
standards of the Ruby Style Guide. The SublimeLinter-rubocop package will
integrate this right into Sublime.
207 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSECTION 24
Must have Add-on Packages
In addition to all the packages talked about in this book, there are a handful of
packages that almost all developer will find useful.
24.1 Emmet
I've already written in depth about Emmet and how it is an absolute must-have for
anyone writing HTML and/or CSS. Read the Emmet section of this book for
everything you need to know about it.
24.2 Text Pastry
When using multiple cursors, occasionally you will need to insert an incremental
number at each cursor. For example, if I have a list of chapters for this book and I
wanted to prepend each line with "Chapter #". I could put a cursor on each line
(more on this in the multiple cursors chapter), type the word "Chapter" and then use
text pastry to insert a numbers 1 through 26.
208 of 225
Sublime Text Power User24.3 Autofilename
As you type paths to images/stylesheets/javascript, your editor should suggest the
next folder or filename. Surprisingly, this isn't a native feature of Sublime Text.
Installing Autofilename will add this functionality, so as you type, you can see a list
of folders, files and even image width/heights.
24.4 HTML + CSS + JSON Prettifyer
Pretty JSON and HTML-CSS-JS Prettify are handy utilities that will take messy/
poorly formatted HTML, CSS or JSON and format and indent it properly. Very
handy when you receive a blob of generated code/JSON that needs to be readable.
24.5 Sidebar enhancements
The sidebar and the sidebar API in Sublime Text are pretty lacking in functionality,
and this can be a burden to users who are coming from editors that are more GUI
driven - some things just need to happen on a right click.
209 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserSidebarEnhancements adds a ton of new functionality to the sidebar.
Open with...
Let's start with opening files in other programs from the sidebar.
Right click and thne Open / Run will open the file in the operating system's
default program for that file type. If it is an HTML file, it will open in your default
browser. For me, HTML files open in Chrome Canary.
But what if I want to open it in FireFox from the sidebar? We need to add another
program. Right click the file, Open With → edit applications... .
This will open up a .sublime-menu JSON file. Go ahead and copy one of the
current applications and fill it out with the information for FireFox.
The two important lines to change here are "ID" and "application" . The
application path will be easy to fill out if you have previously installed the
AutoFileName extension.
210 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserThe extension line will limit this application to certain file types. It makes sense
that we only want to open .HTML and .htm files, so we use
"extensions":"html|htm" . Leaving it blank ( "extensions":"" ) will
show up for everything including folders and you can also use wildcards such as
"extensions":".*" for any file with extension.
Once all is said and done, we have successfully added Firefox to our sidebar "Open
With" using the following code snippet:
// Open with Firefox
{
"caption": "Firefox",
"id": "side-bar-files-open-with-firefox",
"command": "side_bar_files_open_with",
"args": {
"paths": [],
"application": "/Applications/Firefox.app",
"extensions":"html|htm"
},
"open_automatically" : false // will close the view/tab and launch
the application
},
If you are on Windows or Linux, make sure you use the appropriate path to your
programs.
Want all of them? Use the following snippet to add all the browsers to your sidebar:
211 of 225
Sublime Text Power User// Open with Firefox
{
"caption": "Firefox",
"id": "side-bar-files-open-with-firefox",
"command": "side_bar_files_open_with",

More Features
These ones are fairly straight-forward and do not require much explanation. cut /
copy / paste via the sidebar, something Sublime doesn't have by default.
213 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserAs well as a few more advanced features around copying the file, copying the path,
duplicating a file, copying as base64, paste in parent and a handful of other edge
cases.
24.6 JSHint Gutter
JSHint gutter is an alternative to Sublime Linter if you just need JavaScript linting.
It can be easier to setup and provides live linting support, placing flags in the gutter
when something is awry.
If you have already started to write ES6, you should pass on this one and start using
ESLint with Sublime Linter.
24.7 Alignment
The Alignment package is a simple yet very popular add on for Sublime Text.
Some coding style guides require that lines of text be aligned in a certain way. One
of those could be having your = align up when doing variable declaration.
With this package, we can take code that look like this:
Highlight it all and hit ⌘ + Ctrl + A ( Alt + Ctrl + A on windows) making
this:
214 of 225
Sublime Text Power User24.8 Color Highlighter
If you work with CSS, Sass, Less or Stylus, this is a must have package. It will
highlight your CSS colours and show them to you. The trick is getting them to
show up all the time, instead of just when you click a color.
First, install the Color Highlighter package from Package Control
Next, restart Sublime Text.
Then, in Preferences → Package Settings → Color Highlighter → Settings – User
Use the “filled” setting to make them show all the time.
{
"ha_style": "filled"
}

Bracket Highlighter is a very visual aid helping you see where your brackets and
tags start/stop:
Getting colored brackets requires that you install a theme that supports it. Cobalt2
is ready to go.
216 of 225
Sublime Text Power User24.10 Writing Markdown with Sublime Text
Markdown is by far the best way to write. Everything from your project's readme to
blog posts to larger documents such as this book can all be written in markdown.
Using your code editor as a writing tool is far superior to other tools such as Word
or Google Docs. That said, Sublime needs a few packages before you can get the
most out of it as a document writer.
Syntax Highlighter
Sublime Text comes with a fairly good syntax highlighter, so without any packages
you are already setup to start writing markdown.
The package MarkdownEditing provides a suite of tools including two advanced
themes, auto-pairing of markdown syntax such as _underscores _ and *asterisks*,
as well as a handful of keyboard shortcuts.
Compiling
While I recommend using Sublime Text to edit and another program (such as
Marked or Mau) to compile your markdown, there are options available if you wish
to compile right from Sublime Text. Markdown Preview will allow you to compile
to HTML and even preview it in the browser with a single keyboard shortcut.
Table of Contents
MarkdownTOC is a package that will generate a table of contents for your entire
document. Simply run the command MarkdownTOC: Insert TOC once
where you wish to have the table of contents, and it will update the TOC on every
save.
217 of 225
Sublime Text Power UserOnce the comments are in your code, you have the ability the specify how many
title levels deep the TOC will go.
By default, the TOC won't be linked to the title, which is rather annoying, but you
can remedy that by giving each title an ID. MarkdownTOC will notice the ID and
auto-link them.
## Growing Up[growing-up]
I must caution that updating the TOC for large documents can be fairly slow and it
seems to block the editor while it is generating.

Sublime Text Power User24.11 Maintaining State on a File
If you work on large documents, code folding is a great way to hide large chunks of
code when you aren't working on them. The problem with code folding in Sublime
Text is that the folds do not persist between sessions. This means that if you restart
Sublime Text, all your folds are gone!
BufferScroll is a package that will remember a whole slew of things when you
close a file, including:
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
scroll position
cursor positions
selections
marks
bookmarks
foldings
selected syntax
colour scheme
24.12 Expand to quotes
This package was referenced earlier in the Jumping, selecting and moving section.
Sublime has expand selection to [line,word,paragraph,scope,brackets,indentation]
but no "expand to quotes". So, install this one to extend the native functionality to
expand to quotes. Helpful when working with strings or HTML attributes.
https://github.com/kek/sublime-expand-selection-to-quotes
24.13 TODO
If you are the type that adds TODO comments littered through your code, Sublime
TODO is a handy little package that will gather all the references to TODO
comments and compile them into a single, linkable screen.

Tip + Tricks Grab Bag
This section of the book is filled with tiny, yet extremely useful hot tips. While they
might not fit into a chapter of this book, you will no doubt find many cases where
they are useful in your development workflow.
25.1 Converting Case
Whether you are referencing a constant or just toning down some content from an
overly zealous client, the case converting feature of Sublime Text allows you to
convert from and to upper and lower case as well as swap and Title case.
Lower and Uppercase are bound to ⌘ + K , ⌘ + U or L . Swapping case and
titling case do not have a keyboard shortcut but can be easily added with the
title_case and swap_case commands and Chapter 15 of this book.
These commands are quickly available via the command palette and slowly
available via the Edit menu item.
221 of 225
Sublime Text Power User25.2 Code Comments
Every language has code comments. Toggle these commends with ⌘ + / . If
nothing is selected the entire line will be commented out.
If the language supports block commenting, add in option/alt into the mix to
block comment multiple lines of selected code. You can always uncomment a block
comment when the cursor is anywhere block.
25.3 Sort, Reverse, Unique and Shuffle
Take the following code for example. 8 lines with 2 duplicates.
<img
<img
<img
<img
<img
<img
<img
<img
src="item05.jpg">
src="item02.jpg">
src="item01.jpg">
src="item02.jpg">
src="item04.jpg">
src="item06.jpg">
src="item03.jpg">
src="item04.jpg">
First thing we need to do is get rid of the duplicates. This is only available via the
Edit → Permute Lines menu, however you can add a keyboard shortcut
with the permute_lines command and the operation argument set to
unique .
Selecting Unique will remove duplicate lines, leaving up with:

src="item02.jpg">
src="item01.jpg">
src="item04.jpg">
src="item06.jpg">
src="item03.jpg">
Now the lines are already mixed but, but if we wanted some sort of randomness to
them, we could use the shuffle command.
Finally we want to order them, for this use use Sort Lines , available under the
Edit menu or the command palette. That leaves us with:
<img

<img
src="item01.jpg">
src="item02.jpg">
src="item03.jpg">
src="item04.jpg">
src="item05.jpg">
src="item06.jpg">
By now you get the point - we could also reverse them again with the reverse
command.
25.4 Distraction Free / Fullscreen Mode
Sublime Text isn't just for writing code - we reviewed how to use the editor as a
fantastic markdown editor in Chapter 23. Whether you are writing prose or code,
sometimes we just need to focus on what we are writing and nothing else.
For this, Sublime Text offers Fullscreen Mode mode which gives you a
fullscreen editor. For Mac OSX users, this takes up its own space.
One step further, Sublime offers a Distraction Free mode which hides all
tabs, gutters, line numbers and other editor chrome. It's just you and your code.

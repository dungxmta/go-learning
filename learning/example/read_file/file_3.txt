The key to testable code in Go is using interfaces.
When I started to write production Go
code about 9 months ago,
 I was given that exact piece of advice and well,
  it was less than enlightening.
   It was not immediately obvious how interfaces solve this problem.
    My first attempts worked fine,
    but required writing a lot of needless code implementing
     other people’s interfaces for test stubbing.
     It took me awhile to realize how to properly
     leverage Go’s powerful interface mechanism.
This is what I learned and it has drastically
improved the testability of my Go code.
